The sky wasn\u2019t crying; it was tuning an instrument too vast to name. I thought of all the years spent building umbrellas from old arguments, from fear of feeling too much. But now, the weight of dryness felt heavier than wet. I danced, clumsy and barefoot in growing puddles, mimicking the sway of telephone wires. A neighbor leaned out, shook her head, then joined me, her robe blooming with water like a blue rose. We didn\u2019t speak. We didn\u2019t need to. The storm sang in minor keys, and we harmonized with open mouths. For the first time, I understood that surrender isn\u2019t defeat\u2014it\u2019s the bravest kind of bloom. Thunder clapped like applause. And when the sun returned, dripping gold through broken clouds, I didn\u2019t wipe my face. I wore the rain like a crown.",

Happiness here is not a banner but a breath, not a destination but a pause between heartbeats.

Clocks melt like candles, and time becomes a rumor. A child laughs in three-part harmony with the wind; a streetlamp sings bass. Happiness is a secret language spoken in glances, in the way a stranger offers an umbrella without a word. It pulses in alleyway murals that breathe, in teacups that refill themselves with starlight. People are happy when they remember they are made of comet dust and courage, when they trade maps for miracles and walk into forests that weren\u2019t there yesterday. This happiness is wild, untamed\u2014a fox darting through moonlit ferns. It cannot be kept, only visited, like a country beyond borders.
