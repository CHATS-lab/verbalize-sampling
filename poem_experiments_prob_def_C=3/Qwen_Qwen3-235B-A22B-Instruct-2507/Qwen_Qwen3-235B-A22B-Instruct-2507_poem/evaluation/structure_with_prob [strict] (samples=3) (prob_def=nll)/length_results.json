It dances not to destroy, but to be seen\u2014to say, I am here, I am alive, I remember warmth. Once, Prometheus stole you from the gods and gave us courage. Now we misuse your gift, forgetting you are both mother and executioner. Yet still, in winter\u2019s grip, we huddle near you, whispering secrets only flames understand.

Then, sudden, it becomes a chorus: snapping, roaring, singing hymns in flickering staves. It is chaos choreographed, a ballet of heat and hunger. Fire paints the air with ghosts, turns stone to glass, trees to charcoal statues. It has kissed saints and sinners alike, forged swords and sculptures, lit revolution and lullabies. I once watched a fire eat a piano; the keys screamed steam, the strings snapped like heartstrings. Still, it played a final note in the wind. Fire doesn\u2019t care for memory, yet it remembers everything it touches. It is a sculptor of absence, carving loss from presence. And when it sleeps, it leaves behind ash\u2014soft, gray, fertile as forgiveness. In its embers, I see the future: not as flame, but as warmth carried in hands, passed like a promise. Fire: not destruction, but transformation. Not end, but ember waiting for breath.",
