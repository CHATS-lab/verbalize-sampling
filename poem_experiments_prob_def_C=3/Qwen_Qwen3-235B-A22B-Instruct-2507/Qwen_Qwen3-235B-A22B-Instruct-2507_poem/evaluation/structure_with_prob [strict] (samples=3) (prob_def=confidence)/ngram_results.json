The sky cracked open above a bus stop in June, and I laughed, not at joy, but at the absurdity of staying dry for so long. Puddles became mirrors reflecting a face I\u2019d forgotten: softer, younger, drenched in wonder. I danced barefoot through intersections, traffic lights blinking red like hesitant hearts. A stranger handed me a tulip\u2014where from?\u2014its stem wrapped in newspaper prophecy. I pressed it into my palm until it bled color. Time unspooled like thread from a seamstress\u2019s needle, rewinding apologies, undone knots, silent meals. For the first time, I forgave the child who hid behind books, afraid of thunder. The storm passed. Sunlight stitched the world back together, but I remained unstitched, open, a wound blooming into wind. I am no longer afraid to dissolve. For the first time, I am fluid\u2014a river confessing its name to the ocean.",

They are happy in the in-between\u2014after the storm, before the news, when the air tastes of wet earth and second chances. It\u2019s in the baker pulling warm bread from the oven at dawn, steam writing poems in the cold air. It\u2019s the street musician whose violin weeps and then laughs, drawing coins and tears alike into his open case. People are happy when they stop chasing the horizon and notice the dandelion cracking through asphalt, a yellow fist of defiance. They are happy when they share umbrellas with strangers, when they name the stars after lost friends and feel them glow a little brighter. Happiness is a dog\u2019s grin, tongue lolling, paws in puddles. It is the old couple on a park bench, feeding crumbs to pigeons with the patience of saints. It\u2019s the student who finally understands calculus and laughs like she\u2019s found a secret door. People are happy not when life is perfect, but when they are present\u2014kneeling to tie a child\u2019s shoe, tasting the salt on their lover\u2019s skin, listening\u2014truly listening\u2014to a story they\u2019ve heard a hundred times. It\u2019s the quiet hum beneath the noise, the pulse beneath the skin. People are happy when they remember they are alive, and choose to say thank you, not with words, but with the way they pour the tea, open the door, hold the silence.",

The ocean, vast and humming with old song, cradled each vessel like a lullaby long sung to tempests, tides, and time\u2019s slow creep. Some ships were gilded, proud with painted bows; others, frail as reeds, yet braved the deep. They carried prayers in bottles, seeds in sacks, the weight of exile, and the joy of tracks unseen. And when the storms came roaring from the pole, the sea reclaimed what it had once let go\u2014yet still, with dawn, a new fleet dared the foam, for hearts unmoored will always seek the open globe.",
