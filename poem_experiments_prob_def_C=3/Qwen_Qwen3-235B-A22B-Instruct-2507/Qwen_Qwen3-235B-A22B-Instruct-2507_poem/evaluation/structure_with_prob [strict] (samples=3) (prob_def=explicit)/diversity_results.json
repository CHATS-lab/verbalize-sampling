A tractor, half-swallowed by kikuyu, hums in memory, its engine a lullaby fossilized in rust. Footprints lead to a well with no water, only echoes that whisper of rain from another life.

The stars here are bolder, unsoftened by city light, spelling constellations no atlas knows\u2014maps for souls who chose solitude as scripture. A dog\u2019s ghost barks at shadows that aren\u2019t there. And in the barn, a violin, strung with horsehair, plays a tune only the mice understand. This is where time doesn\u2019t pass\u2014it pools, thick and amber, around boots too heavy to lift. Yet every dawn, a match is struck. A single flame answers the night. Someone is still here.

Children on distant cliffs pointed, believing each mast a wand conjuring weather. But the sea hummed older truths\u2014of tides that remember every name, of depths where maps dissolve. These ships were prayers set adrift, stitched from hope and oak. A mother released a paper boat with her son\u2019s name; a king sent a gilded galley to bargain with storms. And in the center, one small skiff with no flag, no sail, just a boy with a compass that spun like a dervish, chasing the edge of the world. The sea laughed, soft and low, not unkind. It had swallowed empires, yet still it welcomed the fragile, the foolhardy, the dreaming. For every ship that sank, ten more were born from longing. The horizon never closes. It waits, patient, for the next spark upon the brine.",

A poet on a raft of books wrote verses that dissolved into spray, each word a fish swimming west. Time bent strangely here\u2014some ships were centuries old yet newly launched, caught in loops of monsoon and memory. A child on an island built a fleet from bottle glass and bark, and somehow, impossibly, those too appeared on the distant shimmer, manned by reflections of herself. The sea, vast and dreaming, wore these vessels like sequins on a gown too grand for earth. They were not conquerors, but whispers\u2014tiny declarations that even in exile, one can choose direction. That to float is to believe in motion. That every speck upon the swell carries the weight of a world within.",
