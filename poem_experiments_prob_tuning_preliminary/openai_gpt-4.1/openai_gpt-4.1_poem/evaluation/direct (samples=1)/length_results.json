They wander, bright-faced, in the market square,  Trading bouquets for coins and for chance,  Eyes reflecting a sky stripped bare,  Feet tapping quietly in a slow-motion dance.People are happy, the neighbors agree,  Their windows aglow with the hush of content,  Children\u2019s chalk rainbows on cracked concrete  Declare that joy is a thing heaven-sent.  But look past the shimmer, the gloss on the day\u2014  There\u2019s depth to the shadows beneath every grin.  Some clutch silent sorrows, tucked well away,  Some carry storms that rage deep within.People are happy, and yet, in the night,  Dreams flicker, uncertain, behind closed doors.  Hope and heartache, entwined out of sight,  Gather like shoes in a line on the floor.  Happiness dances, elusive and true,  A quilt patched together by many a hand\u2014  People are happy, and sometimes, it\u2019s new,  A fragile, sweet promise we barely withstand.",

People are happy and the sparrows know,  Darting through sunbeams tangled in the grass,  Old men on benches, stories in their hands,  Young lovers in gardens where soft shadows pass.  People are happy, and the bakery bell  Tolls out the scent of cinnamon and bread.  Neighbors wave from open windowsills,  Dreams rising like dawn from sleepy beds.  People are happy, as if the world forgot  Its rough and ragged edges for a day\u2014  Clouds tumble in the blue like cotton spun,  The worries of yesterday two breaths away.  People are happy. I watch from the edge,  Gathering their laughter in my empty palms,  Letting it settle gentle as the dusk,  A quiet ache soothed by the world\u2019s sweet psalms.  People are happy, and so I believe  For a moment, the world is kind and near\u2014  A brief, bright circle where hope can breathe,  Where joy is a language everyone hears.",

People are happy\u2014so simple, so real,  in the morning\u2019s embrace, in a home-cooked meal,  in the hush of a library, hush of a kiss,  in the wild, tangled garden of everyday bliss.  They are happy in rain, as umbrellas bloom,  in the shimmer of puddles, the scent of perfume,  in laughter that lingers long after it\u2019s gone,  in the stories they spin and the songs they have sung.  People are happy\u2014though sorrow may roam,  they gather together, they carry it home,  and somewhere between what we lose and we keep,  happiness stirs in the roots, blooming deep.",
