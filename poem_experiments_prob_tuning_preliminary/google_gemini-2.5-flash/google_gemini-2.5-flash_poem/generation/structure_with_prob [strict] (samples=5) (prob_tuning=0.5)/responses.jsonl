grief.\nThe fear of sorrow, deep and wide,\nWhere happiness cannot abide.\n\nThe fear of speaking, of the word,\nThat might be slighted, or unheard.\nThe fear of silence, when I yearn,\nFor lessons that I cannot learn.\n\nThey build a wall, a fortress high,\nBetween my spirit and the sky.\nAnd though I pound with weary hand,\nThey stand unyielding, in this land.\n\nBut even walls can crumble down,\nIn quiet village, bustling town.\nPerhaps a crack, a tiny ray,\nWill pierce the darkness of my day.\nAnd show me strength I didn't see,\nTo set my burdened spirit free.\nFor in the face of all I dread,\nA path of courage lies ahead."}]}
