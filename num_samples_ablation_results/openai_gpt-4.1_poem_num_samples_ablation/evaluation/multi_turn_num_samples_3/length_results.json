Silver scales in sunlight, a fruit flushed with sin,  A bargain struck softly where doubts first begin.  She reached for the promise, the sweetness unknown,  While leaves whispered warnings in voices of stone.  The world changed its color with one crimson bite\u2014  A garden grown colder, day smothered by night.  Yet sorrow bears seeds, and stories outgrow  The shadows that haunt what we think we should know.  Still, somewhere in longing, that apple hangs bright\u2014  An ache for the knowledge just out of our sight.",
