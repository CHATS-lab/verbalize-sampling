Perhaps in her circuits a question will spark:  Is there truth in the light, or just shade in the dark?",

Night stretches onward, a ribbon of gray,  Where memories falter and dreams lose their way.  The hum of the tires is a lullaby\u2019s plea,  Calling the heartache to travel with me.  Street signs point backward to stories I\u2019ve known,  While forward the silence is heavy as stone.  Yet somewhere beyond this endless expanse,  A glimmer of courage invites me to dance.  For even on highways where sorrow still flows,  The promise of sunrise quietly grows.  So I gather my longing, my hope, and my fears,  And drive through the darkness, collecting my tears.  At the highways of woes, I\u2019ll pause and I\u2019ll rest\u2014  For healing is found where the journey is blessed.",

The worries that I always chase  Slip quietly from view\u2014  I find a gentler, slower pace,  A hush I never knew.Now when I have a cold,  I learn the art of rest\u2014  To let the busy world unfold  While I do only what is best.  And though the fever soon will fade,  I\u2019ll keep this lesson near:  To sometimes let the moment wade  In quiet, calm, and clear.",

He spoke of fields, of sweat and song,  Of stubborn pride and weathered kin,  Where right was right, and wrong was wrong,  And poetry could still begin.  Through smoky air and ragged cheer,  Old words grew tender, fierce, and wise\u2014  For in the roughest heart, it\u2019s clear,  A gentle, lyric spirit lies.  He spoke of Burns: the ploughman\u2019s son,  A voice for those who had no name;  In every rough and ragged one,  He saw the soul\u2019s undying flame.",

He spoke of verses born from toil,  Of hearts that beat in battered chests,  Of muddy boots on stubborn soil,  And kindness shining through their jests.

They long for sturdy certainties, for ground that will not shake,  Yet in the trembling moments, hope stirs us awake.For peace is not in stillness, nor in walls that do not move;  The heart needs winds of change to test what it can prove.  When comfort wraps too tightly, and answers close the door,  We lose the urge to wonder, to seek what lies before.Let us honor the unsettled, the questions left unasked,  The restless pulse that calls us to yet another task.

Grief is the thread through the tapestry torn,  A melody sung in a minor key;  It\u2019s the honoring of love that is worn  But endures, quietly, endlessly.",

My feet grew tired on muddy banks, hope flickered in the rain,  Yet I pressed on, drawn forward by love and gentle pain.I watched as sunlight shimmered on water deep and wide,  Reflections of a promise that quietly did abide.  The wind would steal my courage, the night would test my will,  But the river\u2019s steady murmuring urged me onward still.Through thickets and through thunder, through silence and through storm,  I clung to the river\u2019s guidance, its current sure and warm.  And at last, beyond the shadows, where lilies kissed the blue,  I found you waiting, smiling, as if you always knew.Now every time the river sings beneath the setting sun,  I remember all the miles, the battles lost and won.
