Some fear the heights, the spiders' creep, the dark's eerie, endless sleep. But deeper fears, more profound and true, are those that shake our hearts anew. The fear of loss, of love that's lost, the fear of rejection, the cost. The fear of failure, of dreams that fade, the fear of unknown paths we've made. Yet, in this fear, a spark takes flight, a courage born, a beacon in the night. For in embracing fear, we find our strength, our resilience, our hearts at length. We learn to face, to overcome, to rise above the fear that once did bind. And though it still resides, a shadow in our hearts, it no longer holds us captive, but sets us free to start.",

But even as the cold winds howl and whip, The sun rises high, a fiery, golden rip. In Kabul's streets, where war and peace entwine, The weather forecast tells a story, a paradox divine. Of beauty and of strife, of life and death's dark door, The forecast whispers secrets, of a city, forever more.",

The tears fall like rain, a deluge of pain, As the heart, once full, now lies in vain. The words, they stumble, and falter, and fail, To capture the ache, the emptiness, the gale. The silence is loud, a deafening scream, That echoes through the hollows of your dream. Yet, in this darkness, there's a glimmer of light, A chance to confront, to face the night. To let the grief, the anger, and the fear, Flow out, like a river, and bring you near. To the truth of your loss, to the depth of your pain, And to the knowledge that you're not alone in this rain. So let the tears fall, let the words be spoken, Let the silence be broken, and the heart be awoken.",

The taste, a moment's pleasure, brief, Was followed by a sorrow, deep and chief, For in that act, they lost their way, And with it, the Garden's radiant day. Now, in the darkness, they must roam, And search for redemption, a way back home.",
