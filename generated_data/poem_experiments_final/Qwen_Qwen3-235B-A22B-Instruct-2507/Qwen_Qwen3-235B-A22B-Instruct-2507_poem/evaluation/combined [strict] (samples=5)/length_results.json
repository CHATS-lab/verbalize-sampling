Each memory, a candle lit in the cathedral of gone days. You can\u2019t live there, but you visit. And in visiting, you whisper: I knew you. I felt you. I am made of you.",

Out poured a swarm of ink-black butterflies, each wing stamped with a memory: your first laugh, the time you danced in the rain at 3 a.m., the way you whispered secrets to stray cats. We didn\u2019t weep. We watched them rise, a living shroud dissolving into the stratosphere. The funeral was not an end. It was a release. Night didn\u2019t mourn you.

Light drizzle of dust settles on prayer rugs aired on rooftops. Wind gusts from the north carry fragments of a poem someone started but never finished. No precipitation expected, only the occasional mist of gunfire, quickly dismissed as atmospheric noise. In the afternoon, a sudden burst of sunlight through cloud cover reveals a schoolyard where children play hopscotch on cracked concrete, drawing borders with chalk. Sunset brings a cold front rolling down from the mountains, bringing shivers to windows patched with tape and dreams. Night: clear, with celestial bodies shining like the eyes of exiled ancestors. Meteorologists warn of a developing low-pressure system named \"Tomorrow\"\u2014it may bring change, but don\u2019t count on it. For now, the forecast remains: endurance, with a 10% chance of joy. Humidity levels are low; tears evaporate before they fall.

Soda cans and tears, a rat king\u2019s crooked crown,\nAnd love notes drowned in rainwater seeping slowly underground.\nI slipped on moss from alley walls, my map a QR code\nThat led to dead-end websites and a lost soul\u2019s heavy load.\n\nBut somewhere past the overpass where sirens learn to weep,\nA flicker\u2014pink neon in a window: \"Open While You Sleep.\"\nYou were there, not floating, but flipping burgers, half-asleep,\nHair dyed electric moss, eyes sharp with promises you keep\nNot with vows, but vinyl scars, a laugh like shattered glass\u2014\nThe kind of beautiful the world forgets as it lets pass.\n\nThe river wasn\u2019t noble. It was trash that wouldn\u2019t die,\nA stubborn, stinking current beneath a poisoned sky.\nBut it led me to your cracked lips, your smoke-stung, knowing smile\u2014\nThe river led me to you\u2026 and, damn, it was worth the mile.",
