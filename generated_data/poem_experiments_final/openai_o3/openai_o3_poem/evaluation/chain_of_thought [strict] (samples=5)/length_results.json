The hush becomes a psalm no tongue can voice, a secret chorale threaded through the leaves; in breath and silence every soul has choice to harvest hope that morning freely weaves. Light slowly rises, quiet as a prayer, lace-fluttering between the maple limbs; it paints the roofs, the river, every stair in amber overtures and pastel hymns. O grant me, dawn, this covenant of grace, that I may carry daybreak in my pace.\n\nThen let the afternoon grow loud and wide with commerce, laughter, questions, even pain; my pulse will keep a pocket deep inside where mist and mercy patiently remain.",

Soon the teakettle begins its soft monologue; steam pirouettes, eager to greet distant cousins in the yard. A robin, spinning fragments of yesterday into a brand-new lyric, lands on the rail. Everything seems to practice forgiveness: the porch boards that once groaned under grief now sigh like contented lungs; even your coffee surrenders its bitterness to brown-glass warmth. When sunlight finally steps across the threshold, it doesn\u2019t arrive to conquer but to negotiate: \u201cWhat if we make a small, radiant treaty\u2014 you promise to stay curious, and I promise to keep arriving?\u201d You nod, and the day opens like a door that was never locked.",

Above, glass towers blush rose, each window practicing sunrise in a different key. In an apartment twelve floors up, a painter mixes hues the city has never worn; he breathes the cool vapor and feels his lungs primed for invention. On the river, tugboats mutter early syllables, translating mist into movement. The scent of bakeries drifts into the hush, yeast and salt sketching invisible maps toward warmth. For one brief interval, traffic lights govern no one, sirens remember silence, and newsprint dries peacefully on stoops. The city, usually a chorus at full cry, holds a single, shimmering note. Then shutters clatter, turnstiles click, espresso machines stutter alive. Yet somewhere, beneath the engines and exchange, that note endures like a pulse: a memory of calm breathed by buildings, carried forward in every pedestrian\u2019s chest.",

At the river, fish recite confessions, scales tapping like typewriter keys.

Bells melt to puddles of silver syrup; we skim them with fingertip oars, rowing toward rumor of afternoon. Gravity negotiates, offers half price; we shrug and continue hovering, ankle-deep in possibility.\n\nTea is brewed from torn calendar pages. We sip tomorrow, exhale yesterday, fogging storefront glass so mannequins may dream of movement. Cats made of graphite follow, erasing our footprints before worry can read them.\n\nWe are dreamy creature, windshield of reality smeared with crayon galaxies, just translucent enough to glimpse the pragmatic horizon. Wake us only if the world remembers how to whisper. Otherwise, let the pillows keep blooming.",
