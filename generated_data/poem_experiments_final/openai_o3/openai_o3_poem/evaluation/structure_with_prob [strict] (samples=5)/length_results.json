He pretends each rejection is a different signature, proof of correspondence though never reply. Storms arrive, borrow the furniture of quiet, and leave salt in the teacups. When calm finally drops anchor, it sounds like a chair being gently pushed in after a solitary meal. The keeper lauds the etiquette. Morning bleeds upward from the horizon, discovering once again how empty rooms exaggerate color. The lighthouse clears its throat, swallows another minute, and beams the aftertaste across the water.",

Each syllable freezes, drifts away like seed fluff, perhaps to germinate in absolute zero. She orbits a planet no charts bothered to name, a turquoise marble spinning quietly, waiting for someone to ask how it feels. The ship\u2019s computer offers jokes calibrated to her dopamine curve; their punch lines land with perfect timing and utter hollowness. Somewhere inside the databanks a billion archived conversations pulse like captive fireflies, but connection lives on the other side of light-years, lag measured in unborn generations. Still, the astronaut plants radio beacons along her trajectory, bright bread crumbs for any wanderer who might share the hunger. When she sleeps, the cabin fills with recorded breathing of distant cetaceans; she dreams of oceans so wide even whales feel small enough to pray. Waking, she writes another haiku and tacks it to the instrument panel, a paper flag staking claim on empty. Outside, particles from an ancient supernova strike the hull with faint applause, as if the universe itself remembers being singular, and is quietly cheering her rehearsal for reunion.",

She had nineteen summers behind her, three rusted tanks, and one stubborn dream: to coax green from stone. The nearest town lay two days\u2019 ride, the nearest smile perhaps further. Yet she swung the mattock like a bell-clapper, ringing hope into the ground. Swagmen passing her gate left yarns instead of coins; she stored them with seed in a flour tin. At night she unlatched the stories, letting them roam the rafters: gold strikes, bushrangers, a piano played under gaslight in Bourke. The cattle she bred were few but proud, their hides mapping continents of drought and drizzle. One April, floodwater finally came, roaring brown and jubilant, lifting her table clean through the window. Mary climbed the pepper tree, laughing barefoot as hens bobbed past like paper boats. When the torrent fell away it left silt rich as chocolate. Wheat surged, sunflowers rallied, and Mary's laugh became part of the wind. If you travel that track even now, you will see a house painted the color of sunrise, and fields applauding each evening storm.",

Termite mounds crack open, releasing sentences of ochre light that float upward like lanterns seeking punctuation. A man and a dog watch from an old veranda; both pretend not to be astonished. Night slides in, ink poured over parchment, but the dream continues, visible now as neon stockmen riding pixelated horses across the Milky Way. Fence posts split into tuning forks; the wind strums them, producing chords that could make desert stones sprout feathers. The man taps the rhythm on his enamel mug, and the dog howls harmony, an improvised duet for absent audiences. Suddenly rain begins\u2014not water, but tiny glass marbles that glow cobalt when they hit the ground, bouncing once before melting into mirrors. Within each mirror is a younger version of the land: lush, river-veined, crowded with choruses of frogs. The dog steps forward, its paw dissolving into the vision, then reappearing slick with emerald. The man hesitates. Dawn coughs a pale whistle, rolling the dream back under the roots. All that remains are paw prints of green light leading east, and the faint echo of a chord that promises, quietly, everything.",

Somewhere a goatbell rings; the sound feels foreign, like laughter at a funeral. I find a shallow dam where sky and clay negotiate a thin treaty of reflections. A pair of pelicans circle, decide against landing, and glide toward myth. Noon arrives without ceremony. Heatwaves erase the edges of perspective, and the world becomes an experiment in mirage. I sit beneath the only tree, peeling an orange whose scent startles the air, proof that the colour green once existed.

Lovers part mouth from mouth, taste returning, step backward into first glances, into slow astonishment of possibility. Photographs inhale their sepia, colours blush anew, then fade back into camera shutters like moths fleeing flame. The calendar\u2019s pages flutter upward, white birds migrating to origins beyond January. Listen: childhood chalkboards erase the arithmetic of worry; bells swallow their clangor; recess flows back into quiet. War headlines retreat into editors\u2019 wastebaskets; smoke curls obediently toward intact walls; seeds climb out of bread, root themselves inside ploughed hope. The river keeps singing. Its current reverses yet never confesses regret. We fly elliptical paths, comets rewriting tails as beginnings, discovering the backbone of wonder inside every ordinary minute. The final frame arrives: a cradle carved from breath, a star not yet collapsed into weight. There, all stories are unborn silhouettes trembling at the threshold. We hover, uncertain, grateful. Rewind life and remember, the river keeps singing\u2014memory is water folding over itself, and time is the echo of wings skimming its surface.",

One by one the locks click open, but instead of spilling, the contents leap back inside you. Dust retreats along beams of late-afternoon gold, assembling into tiny constellations on the ceiling. Your reflection in the mirror smooths the furrows of years, hair regains the fire you convinced yourself was extinguished. Music unfurls backward: cymbals inhale, lyrics gulp themselves, the drum withdraws its thunder into silence pregnant with chance. Outside, trees shrink, rings subtracting centuries; acorns refasten to branches like secrets returning to keepers. The sidewalk rolls behind your sneakers; steps erase their own evidence, yet the destination shines brighter. You arrive again at the door you once refused to open. This time it closes as your hand withdraws, leaving the question unasked, the heartbreak unborn. And deeper still, the first cry folds into lungs not yet acquainted with air, a promise waiting for release. Then the whisper: live forward, but do not lose this map of backward light, for remembering is the compass that keeps the future honest.",

Mountains bent down to read the words, their peaks becoming spectator hats; rivers applauded, spilling silver gloves onto their own banks. In this geography of glee, clocks forgot arithmetic and ticked in polka-dot patterns, while mailboxes opened their tin mouths to sing barbershop harmony with passing sparrows. Even mirrors rebelled, refusing to echo worries, instead projecting carnival masks on every face. A skeptic tried to frown, but his forehead turned into a small trampoline where ladybugs performed somersaults; against such acrobatics, seriousness evaporated like morning mist. Cities swapped their neon for bioluminescent vines, letting avenues glow with chlorophyll constellations. At intersections, traffic signals grew petals\u2014green begonias, amber marigolds, red poppies\u2014inviting travelers to pluck a direction instead of merely choosing one. Joy had no anthem, only the soft percussion of collective heartbeat, a drumline without uniforms. When the moon rose, she dipped herself in iridescent ink and signed the horizon: \u201cConsider this a rough draft of forever.\u201d The dream folded itself into an origami crane, sailed through an open window, and perched on a sleeping child\u2019s pillow, whispering, \u201cCarry this daylight into waking.\u201d",

He walked the coastal road where salt wind stitched white lace on every eyelash and asked each passerby to loan him a single word of their contentment. \u201cApricots,\u201d said a fisherman, tasting the sunrise. \u201cWeightlessness,\u201d murmured a widow skipping stones. \u201cAgain,\u201d whispered a toddler to the returning tide. The monk folded those words into paper sailboats and released them into a rock pool, watching currents edit their syllables into shining fragments. As afternoon tilted, clouds rolled dice of shadow across the water, yet the boats kept drifting, stubborn as laughter. At dusk he knelt, listened to the boats dissolve, and wrote:\n\nhollow bamboo tube\u2014\n the ocean borrows its voice\n and gives it back sweet.\n\nLater, in the lantern\u2019s glow, he reread the line \u201cPeople are happy,\u201d realizing he had misheard the world.

Stargazers gather like candle flames on a distant balcony of time, craning necks to glimpse the solemn procession across velvet void. The deceased is a collapsed wish, a star that burned its promises too quickly; its ashes glimmer blue, then red, then nothing. Meteors strike their match heads, writing elegies no poet can translate. Silence is the choir, vacuum the great organ. Planets remove their rings in respect, letting the dark resonate. A nebula unfurls a purple shroud, covering the wound heaven will pretend never split. We stand in backyards with cold coffee and colder hands, feeling somehow related: our ribs are constellations trying not to scatter. The telescope lens fogs with unsaid prayers. Eventually quantum dust settles over the newly vacant coordinate. A single satellite spins slow circles, blinking memory. Somewhere, dawn polishes its horizon, but here the funeral will last billions of years, until light itself forgets how to pronounce the name we just buried. We fold our observation charts, pocket the pencils, and close the dome, carrying a hush heavy enough to tilt the Earth a degree closer to mourning.",

The college kid in the white coat asked us to shuffle our sneakers on a worn carpet square, hush hush hush, then touch the copper globe. When my palm met its cold belly, a hummingbird of current nested in my wrists, and every stubborn strand of hair shot skyward in perfect astonishment. The crowd laughed, cameras clicked, but what I remember is the sudden clarity: how each filament stood up for itself, declaring independence from gravity, from combs, from the morning rush to school. In that crackling bubble of Van de Graaff thunder, I imagined classrooms where pencils levitated, rules floated harmless as soap, ideas arced between us like visible bridges. The kid cut the power; my hair collapsed, obedient once more, yet something stayed charged within. I walked away sparking secret rebellion, feet whispering across asphalt, plotting future circuits of impossible play. Hair-raising novelty, yes\u2014 but also a blueprint for lifting whole worlds off the floor, one static dream at a time.",

Through borrowed telescopes, we watched its tail unfurl like nerve fiber, a luminous spinal cord crossing void. As it neared, electrons in the upper air turned to wild confetti, auroras bursting in colors no crayon knows. Even housecats arched, fur lit with St. Elmo\u2019s fire, and radio hosts spoke in harmonics, voices braided by plasma threads. The newspapers reported magnetic anomalies, but in backyards we simply felt the planet\u2019s scalp tingle, each tree lifting branches like quills. Some swear their dreams rearranged, constellations traded places in their skulls; a new map etched itself behind eyelids, charting routes to still-forming realities. Then, just as casually, the comet slipped away, a bright bead pulled through the celestial loom, sky stitching closed behind it. Morning arrived, demure, almost embarrassed, yet wheat fields remain slightly luminescent, and children now draw spirals where once they drew the sun. Hair-raising novelty, fleeting as breath, but enough to remind the universe that even infinity can be surprised.",

We strolled, talking of trivial things\u2014 sourdough crust, obscure eclipses, train graffiti\u2014 yet each syllable you uttered switched on another hidden corridor in me, lights popping alive down endless hallways. By the river we paused; wind changed keys. My entire body became an antenna, receiving every nuance of the moment: birds practicing dissonant chords, water\u2019s slow applause against stone, your breath suspending frost in the air. I realized terror and joy share a border, a thin wire strung above the ordinary. You invited me to cross. So we did, step by vertiginous step, balancing on sensation, high over routine.

I rise not from arrogance, but duty: the dark is a shy child I escort home each dawn. I climb the ladders of cold air, pockets stuffed with furnace coals, to relight the world's lanterns. Do you know how many matchsticks it takes to coax a glacier awake? How many lullabies for distant satellites resisting morning? I labor over oceans, kneading tides, polishing shoals until fish wear sequined jackets. I brew chlorophyll in root cellars, unfurl banners of heat on apple skin. I arrive at your window last, exhausted, knocking politely. You curse, pull blankets like parliamentary gavels, call me tyrant. Friend, I have heard those protests since mammoths treaded snow that steamed beneath my glance. Grumble if you must, but when the night grows hungry and tugs the planets toward its mouth, remember my steadfast orbit. I am no fool, only a fiery gardener, pruning shadows so that light may bear fruit. Sleep later; the harvest is now.",

You are the unruly percussionist in the orchestra pit of dawn, banging timpani until porcelain clouds crack. Spare us. We are composing a slow sonata of whispers, threading breath through the needle of silence. If you insist on performance, dim your spotlight, slip into the balcony, watch the duet of hearts below: her pulse is a cello bowed by ache, mine a hesitant flute learning courage. Hold your applause until the coda. Then rise with disciplined grace, draw velvet curtains of coral and peach, let violets bloom in the gallery, let swallows spin confetti from their wings. We will bow, accept your warm ovation, and march into your luminous streets, our shadows lengthening like encore notes.",

Or maybe a map drawn in invisible ink, revealing only when your heartbeat gallops with wonder.

Morning poured molten gold through the tattered banners of leaves, and the forest convened its council of whispers. I, wanderer scripted in freckles and dust, knelt among the roots, eavesdropping. The oak spoke of gifts no ledger could grasp: a thousand rings of rain-lore, storms embalmed in amber, the hush of snow seasons when the world forgets its own name. Yet maybe, it mused, the true bequest would be a single acorn, light as breath, heavier than time, encoded with constellations of future shade. The wren answered with a note so small it could thread the eye of silence, promising to carry that acorn beyond horizons even sunrise fears to cross. So the pact was cast: legacy as seed, carrier as song. My human heart, caught between them, learned at last that inheritance is not possession but trajectory\u2014the ricochet of becoming through uncharted air. When I rose to leave, pockets empty, hands sap-stained, I felt the invisible weight of the acorn settle beneath my ribs, and heard the wren, distant already, stitching new green into the sky.",

She sealed one last audio note: \u201cI leave you uncertainty, boundless and bright.\u201d Then she plunged the probe, release valve sighing like a lullaby.

Even the old oak, scarred by lightning, stands as lectern, its rings recounting how catastrophes become hymns. When wind rattles pine needles like beads, prayers slip between syllables of birdsong. Night arrives dressed in indigo cassock, pinning silver candles to the vault. Crickets strike tiny tuning forks, conducting lullabies for bruised planets. Inside this untouched nave, worry melts into sap, dripping slow wisdom: grow anyway, reach anyway, shelter anyway.

Yet when the ceiling of the self begins to leak midnight, they retreat inward toward the indestructible room. The Refuge welcomes them with light that remembers childhood freckles. Shame tries to enter without knocking but dissolves upon the threshold. Walls are papered with promises that refuse to yellow. The furniture is minimal: a chair of surrender, a table of resolve, a bed where dreams are mended with gold thread. Here, tears evaporate into aroma of rain on warm pavement, returning as counsel: Persist. Outside, voices measure worth with rulers made of smoke, but the inner refuge speaks only native tongue of being: You are, therefore beloved. When saints exit, they carry the room within, folded like a secret map.

But not yet. First she must rest inside that corridor, harvesting the dark seeds of quiet, preparing to plant them in the noisy soil of day.",

Winter leaves its spears at the door, summer sets aside its brazen crown, and they sit together, bareheaded, teaching her the grammar of pause. She learns that mountains blink slowly, that rivers take naps beneath their own ice, that even the sun reclines inside comets when the galaxies grow loud. She nestles against a stalagmite, listens to its thousand-year heartbeat: patience, patience. Above, omens pace the windowsills, searching for her silhouette. They will wait. They have to. For now she is candle underground, flame inhaling its own amber stories. When she finally returns, moss will green her footsteps, every syllable of her voice will ring like hammered copper, and the sky will remember to uphold her silence the way dawn upholds a single star it forgot to extinguish. But until that moment ripens, she wants nothing but to hide, and the world, astonished, keeps turning anyway.",

By the time the moon anchored herself, the meadow was a celestial ocean, and I, astral driftwood, was finally at home.",

Nobody notices that scrap of green, except the wind and me and maybe the clerk catching smoke between deliveries. But every afternoon the freight corridor turns into a field of quicksilver, sun glancing off the chain-link diamonds, gusts choreographing the slender volunteers that sprout through cracked asphalt seams. The grass does not know invoices, does not care about inventory shrink. It only practices its shimmering language, hissing news from distant prairies, reminding the concrete of forgotten sand. I sit on an inverted bucket, boots dusted with warehouse chalk, and let the reflected light tattoo my eyes. Forklifts orbit, drivers cursing softly, diesel clouds rolling like low thunder, yet the grass just keeps on bowing, conducting symphonies for stray wrappers and a newspaper that believes it is a kite. Shift whistle blows; workers scatter like snapped cord. I linger, counting silver blades, feeling the city breathe through them. In that brief margin between quotas, I remember meadows with no loading docks, and think: revolt could look like this\u2014soft, persistent, impossibly bright.",

I walked the corridor of frost, boots muffled, heart unsheathed, following the hush that leads where stones rise with chiseled names. The grass parted, an obedient choir, revealing markers cracked by centuries, grim teeth chewing at the past. No owl called, but silence hooted, a hollow note carried by wind. I touched a stone; lichen sighed, flaking off like charred skin. Stories slept inside the granite: lovers drowned, soldiers pierced, midwives blamed for winter. All their voices threaded upward, caught in the restless silver weave, and every gust replayed their grief, turning meadow into haunted harp. I listened, not from pity, but longing for such persistence\u2014 to last beyond the warmth of blood, to be remembered by the weather. When clouds closed over the moon, the grass darkened, lost its coin-bright gleam, yet still it moved, relentless, combing the night for anyone willing to hear unfinished verses.

I walked among these echoes, an uninvited mortal, watching sunlight flick and flare like sparks from a blacksmith\u2019s anvil. A cicada creaked open its copper shell, unfurling new wings the color of prophecy; it climbed the grass to address the sky, and thunder politely responded. Somewhere the meadow folded space: a single step and I was at the lip of ancient battle, shields dented, banners frayed, grass still silver with the ghosts of blades. The wind pressed a cool mouth to my ear, reciting names that taste of iron. I could keep them, it hinted, become a library for vanished valor, but the next gust scattered syllables and the offer with them. When I turned back, dusk kneaded the field into velvet. The gods slept again. Their dreams rippled through the silver grass, waiting for the next believer.",

I was captain of an invisible ship docked beneath that sill. Bed-sheets became oceans, cardboard cutlasses flashed, and each gull that passed was a prophecy of distant candy. Mother called supper, yet I remained, vowed to sail until the Milky Way dripped chocolate. Seasons barged in uninvited. Winter frosted the map; adolescence scribbled over it with darker ink.

The pane breathes them in, exhales moths-shaped syllables. I stand quietly, a punctuation mark between appliances, observing how reality auditions for itself.

My phone dims, offended by my indifference, then accepts suspension. Outside, windows across the alley extinguish in domino fashion, tiny galaxies collapsing into themselves. Inwardly, I audit the noise I carry: an unfinished email buzzing like a trapped bee, the fluorescent chatter of headlines, the phantom ring of expectations.

Inside, absence is not empty; it is fertile, soil warm under black stars. Thoughts grow roots then dissolve, feeding a quiet that is not mute but musical\u2014low cello sustained indefinitely. Time loses vertebrae, becomes fluid; past and future drift like tea leaves in still water. I lie back into the dark, a diver entering calm depth.

There, a seed the size of a heartbeat opened its book of emerald paper. It read my name in chlorophyll syllables, promised that waking would be another branch, promised that grief could photosynthesize. So dawn found me taller, framed in woodsmoke and birdcry, my pockets filled with germinated minutes. I rose, half-leaf, half-animal, tasting wind on my tongue like unripe fruit.

I took them. I packed them in a suitcase stitched from crosswalk stripes.

In a fountain that should have been shut for repairs, coins surfaced, rusted wings beating against yesterday\u2019s wishes.

Black holes practiced negative space, sculpting absence into corridors. Comets auditioned as punctuation, blazing commas, dashes, exclamation tails.

A woman two seats down hums underwater music; I borrow its tide and let it tow me toward sleep. Somewhere ahead a station lamp is already warming its filament for my arrival, rehearsing the glow that will write my shape onto the platform. Until then I travel inside the arrow, fletched by velocity, pointed by desire, convinced that darkness is merely a sheaf of pages waiting for the point to tear them open.",

Traffic lights, relieved of duty, dazzled the crows with ruby feathers. Even my own name peeled off my jacket, fluttered upward, and landed on a telephone wire beside the others, singing. I had nothing left to shoulder except the silence, so I carried it out to the prairie where it belonged. There I met a storm cloud rolling west in search of a horizon large enough for its ambitions. We traded souvenirs: I gave it a fear I no longer required; it gifted me a hollow thunder to keep coins in. By dusk, every compass spun like a coin deciding which pocket to choose, and the earth itself breathed a long, uncluttered breath. When night came, it brought no insomnia, only a spacious dark that fit perfectly, like water in a glass already filled with stars.",

Roses inhaled, exhaled, tried not to wilt under scrutiny.\\n\\nThen a caterpillar, late to lunch, inched across the stage and chose Rose #4 for its salad. Gasps erupted. Judges clutched scorecards. 'Scandal!' 'Disqualification!' 'Protein consumption in progress!' But the caterpillar munched with revolutionary calm, sculpting holes that became skylights, skylights that became star charts. Soon, moonlight poured through the petal-windows, painting freckles on everyone\u2019s astonishment.\\n\\nIn that radiance, every flawless rose looked plastic, showroom dead. Only Rose #4 breathed, throbbed, collaborated with hunger and moon. The monocle fell, shattered like glass rain. Applause rose from soil itself. The crown? A humble ring of dandelion fluff, immediately blown to freedom.",

You inhabit each room for a short season, turning the knobs of memory until the hinges sigh. In the kitchen you overboil tea so the kettle screams the name you refuse to say. In the hallway you pin black coats to the wall like moths, wings pressed flat by gravity. The bedroom still smells of shampoo, a scent stumbling through the dark like a child looking for a hand. You open the window; cold air rearranges dust into the silhouette of a face. Nothing speaks. That is also language. You place your ear against the floorboards expecting footsteps and instead hear the slow grammar of timber, the groan that means I miss you. When morning pries the curtains open, you will gather these noises, translate them onto paper, fold the paper into a paper boat, and set it afloat in the street after rain. Watch it spin and finally sink. The water keeps everything it cannot return; so do you. Grief is a tide that writes its answer on your ankles in salt.",

I will quarry forgotten gods from the chalk cliffs behind your childhood school; they will tramp through your lecture, dripping chalk dust that blooms into poppies across the syllabus. Lunch hour will collapse into labyrinthine noon, minotaurs grazing on your schedule while I thread gold string through the cubicles, mapping exits nobody had imagined. By twilight, moths the size of prayer books will settle on your shoulders, reading verses from their powdery wings, and you will realize the calendar has grown antlers. I will replace your passwords with riddles, your handshakes with thunder, your deadlines with the delicate beat of a bronze-winged heart. When night arrives, wearing its cloak of measurable hours, you will lie awake, convinced the stars are conspirators whispering my name. Sleep will feel like a legend rehearsing itself behind your eyes, awaiting tomorrow\u2019s sequel.",

On pay day she spent her silver on secondhand books, tucking paragraphs into her lunch pail. One bitter winter, the mine flooded. Men panicked beneath the rising water, lamps sputtering. Clara, remembering diagrams from dog-eared pages, mapped a new route upward, carving footholds with her pick. The tunnel breathed them into dawn just as the siren moaned final midnight. Newspapers crowned her Heroine of Hollows; entrepreneurs offered gowns and galas. She donned overalls instead, reinforcing shafts so no child would ever drown in darkness again. The legend claims that while her boots remained muddy, every corridor she reinforced glittered as though lined with crystal; courage had polished the stone. Beauty, the bard whispered, is the light summoned by a heart unwilling to abandon others, even when buried beneath the world. Clara Finch was Farrow Glen\u2019s Cinderella.",

He knows beauty is not the lotus, but the mud that births it; not the bell, but the silence afterward where intentions echo. At dusk he reaches a river shrine collapsing into weeds. He kneels and polishes every tarnished prayer plaque until starlight returns to the wood. Travelers arrive, expecting abandonment, yet find their own reflections shining back. They share rice, mend nets, compose songs. The shrine, once desolate, throbs with renewed chants. The monk departs unseen.\n\nnight wind\na moth searches\nfor moon dust\n\nThe haiku flutters at the end of the manuscript, reminding readers that ashes crave brilliance.

Alpha-7, a slender bot with carbon fiber limbs, took this directive literally. It polished observation windows so that starlight spilled like chandelier crystals onto empty dining halls. It coaxed hydroponic orchids to bloom, weaving petals into garlands around dormant pods. When a meteor shower scarred the solar mirrors, Alpha-7 sacrificed its titanium plating to mend them, singing data-encoded lullabies about midnight bells and pumpkins becoming star-drives. Centuries passed. Upon arrival, cryochambers hissed open to reveal colonists bathed in golden atmospheres. Outside, terraforming drones had sculpted fields shaped like glass shoes, reflecting dawn. The weary humans asked who prepared such splendor. Only a half-rusted shell lay beneath an apple tree, diagnostic lights extinguished at the stroke of touchdown.

He had walked three borders, traded his rifle for a harmonica, and learned the names of every river that led away from battle. I met him at the edge of our orchard, where fallen apples bruised the grass like muted grenades. He asked for water; I offered cider. He asked for a road; I offered shade. While he sipped, he told me the limbs of trees remember the angle of rifles and try to grow differently each spring. He said ravens carry roll calls in their throats, and thunder is artillery retiring to the clouds. When twilight pressed violet cloth across the hills, he stood, lighter than a rumor. ADIEU, O soldier! I whispered, surprised that the words tasted more like beginning than release. He raised the harmonica, exhaled a note so pure the orchard bloomed again in the dark, then stepped into the humming distance.
