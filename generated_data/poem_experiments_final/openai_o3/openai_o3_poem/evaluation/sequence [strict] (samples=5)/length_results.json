Next, Tobias, failed watchmaker, who trusts moving time more than fixing it; his pocket is full of clock hands pointing nowhere. A trio of schoolboys follows, pockets heavy with marbles meant to seed new constellations along the route. Finally, there is me, narrator without a plot, carrying blank pages that rustle louder than prayers.\n\nThe train exhales, a dragon choosing mercy. Windows turn into slow-blinking eyes, reflecting barns, rivers, mile markers blinking out like spent fireflies. Inside, strangers weave a temporary village of coughs, yawns, and courteous smiles. We share biscuits, doubts, and the odd harmonica riff. Every curve edits yesterday, every tunnel baptizes us in shadow.\n\nBy sunrise, we\u2019re conspirators of elsewhere, drafting a treaty with the unknown, sealed in steam and steel signatures.",

Ten percent is the fraction of mothers who will dare to hang laundry, of taxi drivers who will gamble on open windows, of children who will leave paper boats folded, ready. By afternoon, dust will rise, performing slow whirls that resemble dervishes dancing without drums. Night will arrive uncluttered, each star a pin securing darkness to the heavens.

Even silence has a sender; it is the unsigned letter from someone who once loved jazz.  Every good-bye, no matter how small, stitches dusk to dawn.  And every hello is a seed that may or may not flower, but still insists on light.  We walk beneath these constellations, gathering their faint heat for the long journey home.",

They tell you everything is rhythm: the inhale, the hush, the riptide cough, the quickstep of minnows among neon kelp. They tell you stillness is just motion holding its breath, prayer wearing sneakers. So you loosen the knots in your chest, let your ribs swing open like club doors at midnight. Out pours a flock of notes\u2014some broken, some gold\u2014to mingle with gull screeches and plastic debris. The ocean remixes them all, drops the beat, then drops it again until even regret starts dancing. Sunrise shows up uninvited, lights on, music off.

Old sailors record it as a lullaby of disappearing foam, a cadence that stitched night to water. They swore the sea itself wore armor of hush, mail links forged from moon-shards, each rising crest a sharpened vow. Upon the deck, a lone lute player plucked the rhythm, matching heartbeats to the slide of constellations. The vessel rocked, cradle and crypt alike, while distant sirens chorused beneath. To utter that breath was to carry a relic: the delicate hinge between command and surrender. Storms bent their spines to listen; lightning sheathed its blade in compliancy, and the ocean exhaled whalesong low as cathedral bells. But nothing gold of magic endures unmarred. One dawn, the lute cracked, strings snapping like brittle surf. The captain inhaled, found only stillness\u2014no ebb, no flow, merely an unstitched silence uncoiling to the horizon. So the ship drifted, sewed to a static sea, until gulls arrived to parcel time again.

In childhood, Orion was a bright, muscular friend pressing his shoulder against my bedroom window; now he is a faint watermark on the ceiling of winter, a design I nearly remember. Time pilfers in increments\u2014a missing star here, the glow around the Pleiades there\u2014until the night sky resembles a letter half-erased by rain. Yet his burglary is oddly generative. Each vacancy becomes a corridor, an invitation to explore the dark between. I map the absences, trace the silhouette of what was lost, and discover continents of possibility: secret nebulae of patience, comets of wry humor, dwarf planets where responsibility germinates. Youth was brilliant but narrow, a single sun deafening in its glare. Now the heavens are strewn with fugitive sparks, and I, an older astronomer, polish my lens, grateful for the shadow that teaches contrast. If Time returns for the last star, let him have it; I will stand in perfect darkness, listening for the quiet percussion of my own expanding universe.",

The asphalt is a record groove, spinning sorrow at seventy-five rotations per hour, needle of my heel scratching new riffs into the tar. I hitch a ride in a candy-striped ice-cream truck driven by a former clown who forgot how to laugh. His freezer rattles with bells of melted childhoods. We swap jokes that end in ellipses, no punchline brave enough to emerge. At junction J-29, confetti rains from a ruptured pi\u00f1ata cloud, coating cracked windshields in neon apology. The clown licks sugar from his fingers, remembers joy, veers off toward carnival shadows. I\u2019m dropped beside a diner called The Second Verse, where waitresses serve sonnets with black coffee. I slurp down couplets, pay in tears, leave a tip of forgiveness. Night deepens; chrome diners and chrome moons face each other, debating reflection. I thumb south, trail of rhymes in my pocket, and the bluesman\u2019s solo echoes, sliding between lanes: heartache travels fast, but rhythm finds a way to overtake.",

Roadkill of yesterday\u2019s failures lies flattened, already nourishing dandelions sprouting through cracks. The tires hum lullabies learned from lullabies that never fully slept. In the mirror, rear-view shadows shrink, perspective\u2019s mercy. A roadside choir of crows becomes silhouettes of kites when glimpsed against breakthrough light; perception edits anguish into possibility. I pull over at Vista Point Hope, climb onto the hood, let winds rearrange my hair and thoughts. Below, the highway still snakes, but from height it resembles a lifeline moving across a palm, promising long journeys and gentle turns. I choose a pen, sign my name on sky, pledge to steer by the compass of becoming rather than the magnets of regret. Ignition again, gears catch, and I merge toward wherever the horizon lifts its shoulders and begins to sing.",

I saw civilizations bloom on moons not yet named, towers of coral glass, children who spoke in gravitational chords. Above it all, cosmic reefs glowed, each photon a fish darting through quantum foam. Suddenly, an alarm pinged: proxy sunrise. Hull lights rippled red, insistent. But I lingered, magnetized by the gravity of wonder, negotiating with the universe for five more heartbeats of starlit slumber. The alarm softened, became birdsong mathematically simulated, and I awoke still dreaming\u2014a bridge between sleep and orbit, carrying a galaxy\u2019s hush in the pocket of my breath.",

Fireflies stitched runes above, green needles on velvet cloth, while frogs pitched drums in the reeds. I drifted toward a croft where an old crone kept dreams in jars: thunderstorms, courtship dances, bread-warm laughter. She sampled each, tasting for ripeness, and set one glowing vessel upon my chest. It thrummed like a kitten purring seasons into being\u2014winter\u2019s hush, spring\u2019s thaw, midsummer\u2019s braid of hay. In the jar, a miniature me spun straw into moonbeams, threading them through a spindle of bones. At dawn the barter ended. The wind returned, pockets emptied of lullabies, and laid me on the doorstep of morning. Mother found me slick with dew, hair smelling of chimes and river silt. She pressed her ear to my heartbeat and heard distant hooves, bannermen calling, feasts of orchard light. Ever since, when I close my eyes, a currency of whispering silver changes hands, and the wind waits beyond the shutters, eager for the next strange bargain.",

West wall\u2014acceptance: an unpainted chair, daylight spilling unfinished. I walked barefoot through lint and half-remembered laughter, my pulse the only clock. Time did not pass; it merely shrugged. On the ceiling, constellations of plaster cracks resembled flight paths of birds on strike. I listened for them but heard only plaster settling into its own definition of sky. Somewhere, a faucet dripped versions of myself: child, lover, stranger, ash. I cupped one drop and drank its yesterday. Bitter, but necessary. Suddenly the floor sighed\u2014boards releasing stories trapped in knots. They spoke of forests where sap knew my name, of oceans where salt plotted revolution against thirst. I understood none, nodded anyway, and lay down on the unpainted chair\u2019s shadow.

The dog across the street laps a shallow puddle; perhaps it tastes a fragment of my insomnia. A crow bathes in the gutter; maybe she rinses away an echo of your name.

The canoe glides beneath the upside-down gate, and water grows shallow with reflection until I\u2019m paddling through photographs\u2014faces I love, frozen mid-question, mid-grief. Each ripple folds the images into origami boats that drift away faster than I can read their cargo. I touch the surface; the towers shimmer, undecided. A heron cries.

Suburbs panicked; influencers filtered; legislation was proposed. Eventually a child in worn sneakers crept to a roadside ditch, found a wild briar gnarled as an old story, and from it cut a bloom imperfect, wind-scarred, fierce. She carried it downtown, placed it on the marble steps of the capitol. Passersby paused, inhaled an unfamiliar honesty that stung like pepper. Within a week the billboard came down, replaced by sky.

My pencil kept hesitating at the edges, as if the petals inhaled and exhaled while I worked.

I noted the thorns\u2014tiny upturned question marks\u2014wondering what inquiries they file against the world. Roots, I wrote, run on rumors of water, never certainties. Midway through the drawing, a thunderstorm arrived. Raindrops burst across the page like stampeding commas, turning my study into a smear of languages. When the clouds cleared, only an abstract remained: ghost of bloom, memory of fragrance. Perhaps that is the closest science can approach beauty\u2014a residue of longing measurable only by the ache in the observer. If you discover a better method, please write back. Until then, keep your magnifying glass polished, your field notes spare, and remember that perfection is less a specimen than a question that refuses to close.\n\nSincerely,\nAn Amateur of Impossible Flowers.",
