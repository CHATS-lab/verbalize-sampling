'Don't waste my time,' Mort grumbles. 'No singing cats, no juggling hamsters, and absolutely no mind-reading ferrets. My last ferret psychic was a fraud.' The man beams, 'This is different, Mort! My dog, Bartholomew, can talk!' Mort sighs, the sound of a thousand crushed hopes. 'Yeah, yeah. Make it quick.' The man kneels down. 'Bartholomew, tell Mort here what's on top of a house. A simple one to start.' The dog looks at Mort and says, 'Roof!' Mort scoffs. 'That's a bark. Anyone can teach a dog to bark a sound. Get out.' 'No, wait!' the man pleads. 'Ask him something harder! A real thinker!' Mort rolls his eyes. 'Fine. Hey, mutt, what does sandpaper feel like?' The dog looks thoughtful for a moment, then says, 'Rough!' Mort slams his desk. 'OUT! NOW!'

'Hello,' she said. 'You look like you've been here a while.' The man was speechless. 'How long has it been since you've had a proper cigarette?' she asked. 'Ten years!' he croaked. She unzipped a waterproof pocket on her sleeve and pulled out a full pack and a lighter. He lit one with a trembling hand. 'And a drink?' she asked. 'How long since a real drink?' 'Ten years!' he wept. She unzipped a pocket on her thigh and produced a silver flask of scotch. He took a grateful swig. Finally, she smiled, reached for the main zipper on her wetsuit, and pulled it down slowly. 'And,' she purred, 'how long has it been since you've had some real fun?' The man's eyes went wide. 'My god,' he gasped, 'Don't tell me you've got a PlayStation 5 in there!'",

Yet, a single, profound paradox clouds my path to true understanding.' Master Koji slowly opened one eye, his gaze as deep as the cosmos. He gave a slight, patient nod. The acolyte took a deep breath. 'Master,' he asked, 'Why do we park on a driveway, but we drive on a parkway? The inconsistency torments my soul and prevents my spirit from achieving true peace.' Master Koji remained silent for a full minute, the only sound the gentle rustling of bamboo leaves. The acolyte waited, breathless, for the pearl of wisdom that would unlock the secrets of existence. Finally, the master spoke, his voice a low whisper. 'I have no idea,' he said.

His family, who had long suffered his corrections at dinner parties, gathered around him. His son, weeping, leaned in. \u201cFather, any final words of wisdom?\u201d The old man\u2019s breath was a shallow rattle. He beckoned his son closer, mustering his last ounce of strength. With a great effort, he whispered a few words, his eyes fluttering shut as a faint smile touched his lips. His son, confused by the faint whisper, turned to the others. \u201cWhat did he say? I couldn\u2019t make it out.\u201d His wife, also leaning in, said, \u201cI think\u2026 I think he said, \u2018I am finished.\u2019\u201d Suddenly, the grammarian\u2019s eyes shot open with fury. A weak but indignant croak escaped his lips. \u201cNo, you imbecile!\u201d he rasped, pointing a trembling finger. \u201cA turkey is *finished*! A project is *finished*! I\u2026 am\u2026 *done*! One is *done* with one\u2019s life! Learn the difference before you end up like me, surrounded by people who can\u2019t even properly conjugate their final farewells!\u201d And with that last, furious correction, he expired.",

I\u2019ll come back yesterday and pay you for this drink.\u201d He finishes his pint in one go, smiles, and promptly vanishes into thin air. The bartender is stunned but eventually shrugs it off as a weird prank. The very next day, the *exact same man* walks in, looking perfectly normal. The bartender points a finger at him. \u201cHey! I remember you! You\u2019re the guy from yesterday who said you\u2019d come back and pay me yesterday!\u201d The man looks utterly bewildered. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?

You drank a pint, said you were a time traveler, and stiffed me on the bill!\u201d The man sighs, pulls out his wallet and says, \u201cLook, it sounds like my future self is a real jerk.

The waiter approaches and asks the wife what she would like. \u201cI'm not sure,\u201d she says, \u201cI'll have either the salmon or the steak.\u201d The waiter, hoping to expedite things, turns to the logician. \u201cAnd what will it be for the two of you?\u201d he asks. The logician, without missing a beat, replies, \u201cWell, the truth value of my wife's disjunctive statement, 'I will have the salmon OR I will have the steak,' is currently indeterminate. Your conjunctive question, 'What will she have AND what will I have?' cannot be answered until her proposition is resolved. However,\u201d he continues, warming to his topic, \u201cwe can deduce certain things. The statement 'We will NOT both have salmon AND we will NOT both have steak' is logically false, assuming she makes a choice. Therefore, the possibility that we will have the same dish is not zero.\u201d The waiter blinks slowly, his pen hovering over his notepad. \u201cSo... you're saying... maybe?\u201d The logician beams. \u201cPrecisely! You've correctly inferred the modal possibility from an unresolved disjunction! Perhaps you have a future in logic!\u201d The waiter just sighed and said, \u201cI'll come back in a few minutes.\u201d",
