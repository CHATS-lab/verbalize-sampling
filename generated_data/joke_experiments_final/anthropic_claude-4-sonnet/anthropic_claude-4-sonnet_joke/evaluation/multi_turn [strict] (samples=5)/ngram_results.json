Confused, the mathematician asks, \"Why do you keep bringing me beers? I only ordered one!\"\n\nThe bartender grins and says, \"Well, you said you wanted to stay within reasonable limits... and technically, any finite number is reasonable compared to infinity. You're currently at beer number 47, which is still infinitely far from infinity, so you're well within your limits!\"\n\nThe mathematician sighs, pulls out his phone, and calls his wife: \"Honey, I'm going to be late. I'm trapped in a logical paradox at the bar, and the only way out is through mathematical induction... or a taxi.\"",

Every time they tried to set boundaries, infinity would just keep going... and going... and going. Plus, infinity was always comparing their love to other relationships, saying things like \"My feelings for you approach but never quite reach the intensity I had with my ex, asymptotically speaking.\"\n\nThe final straw came when the mathematician asked infinity to move in together, and infinity replied, \"Sure, but I'll need infinitely many closets for my stuff.\"\n\nNow the mathematician is dating a nice rational number. Sure, she can be a bit predictable with her repeating patterns, but at least when she says \"I love you 1/3 as much as yesterday,\" he knows exactly what that means and can graph their relationship's trajectory with confidence.",
