Every time it opened its mouth to filter-feed, it would instinctively stuff everything into its cheeks until it looked like a floating beach ball with fins. The poor thing would swim around the ocean looking like it was perpetually blowing the world's largest bubble, and whenever it tried to dive deep, it would just bob back to the surface like a cork because its cheeks were full of air!\n\nThe worst part? It built the tiniest whale song - instead of the deep, majestic calls that travel for miles underwater, the whamster could only manage tiny squeaks that sounded like \"eep eep eep.\" Other whales kept swimming up expecting to find a lost calf, but instead they'd discover this enormous rodent doing barrel rolls and looking very confused about why it couldn't fit through the little plastic tubes at the aquarium.",
