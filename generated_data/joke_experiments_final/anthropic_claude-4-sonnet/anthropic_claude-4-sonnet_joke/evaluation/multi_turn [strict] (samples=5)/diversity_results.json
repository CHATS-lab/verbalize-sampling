Every time they tried to set boundaries, infinity would just keep going... and going... and going. Plus, infinity was always comparing their love to other relationships, saying things like \"My feelings for you approach but never quite reach the intensity I had with my ex, asymptotically speaking.\"\n\nThe final straw came when the mathematician asked infinity to move in together, and infinity replied, \"Sure, but I'll need infinitely many closets for my stuff.\"\n\nNow the mathematician is dating a nice rational number. Sure, she can be a bit predictable with her repeating patterns, but at least when she says \"I love you 1/3 as much as yesterday,\" he knows exactly what that means and can graph their relationship's trajectory with confidence.",

Better entertainment than anything on Netflix!\"",

What do they say?\"\n\n\"Well, the cows mostly complain about work-life balance, the chickens are always clucking about their housing situation, the pigs think the whole operation stinks, and the rooster believes he's management because he sets everyone's schedule.\"\n\nThe entrepreneur pulls out his phone to take notes. \"This is incredible market research! What about solutions?\"\n\nThe farmer grins, \"Same as any workplace - better snacks, more comfortable seating, and they all want Fridays off. Difference is, my employees actually produce something useful every day and never ask for a ping-pong table.\"",
