It starts with 0 and 1, and keeps adding numbers to the sequence as long as they are less than `n`.\n\n### Bug 2: The `sum_even_fibonacci` function is correct\nThis function correctly calculates the sum of even numbers in the Fibonacci sequence up to `n`.\n\n### Bug 3: No bugs in the main function\nThe main function correctly handles user input, validates it, and calls the appropriate functions.\n\nActually, I don't see any bugs in this code. It should work correctly to:\n1. Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a given limit\n2. Calculate the sum of even numbers in that sequence\n3. Handle invalid inputs appropriately\n\nLet me trace through an example to verify:\n\nFor input n = 10:\n- fibonacci(10) will generate [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]\n- sum_even_fibonacci(10) will sum up the even numbers: 0 + 2 + 8 = 10\n\nThe code will correctly output:\n```\nFibonacci sequence up to 10: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]\nSum of even Fibonacci numbers: 10\n```\n\nThis appears to be working as expected.

Let me walk through how the provided code works:\n\n## The Algorithm Overview\n\nQuicksort works by:\n1. Selecting a 'pivot' element from the array\n2. Partitioning the array around the pivot (elements less than pivot go to the left, greater go to the right)\n3. Recursively applying the above steps to the sub-arrays\n\n## Code Breakdown\n\n```python\ndef quicksort(arr, low, high):\n    if low < high:\n        # pi is the partitioning index, arr[pi] is now at the right place\n        pi = partition(arr, low, high)\n        \n        # Separately sort elements before and after partition\n        quicksort(arr, low, pi - 1)\n        quicksort(arr, pi + 1, high)\n```\n\nThis is the main quicksort function that:\n- Takes an array and the starting and ending indices\n- Checks if there are at least two elements to sort (low < high)\n- Calls the partition function to find the correct position for the pivot\n- Recursively sorts the two sub-arrays created by the partition\n\n```python\ndef partition(arr, low, high):\n    # Choose the rightmost element as pivot\n    pivot = arr[high]\n    \n    # Index of smaller element\n    i = low - 1\n    \n    for j in range(low, high):\n        # If current element is smaller than or equal to pivot\n        if arr[j] <= pivot:\n            # Increment index of smaller element\n            i += 1\n            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n    \n    # Place pivot at its correct position\n    arr[i + 1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i + 1]\n    return i + 1\n```\n\nThe partition function:\n1. Selects the rightmost element as the pivot\n2. Initializes an index `i` that will track where smaller elements end\n3. Iterates through the array from `low` to `high-1`\n4. When it finds an element smaller than or equal to the pivot, it:\n   - Increments `i`\n   - Swaps the current element with the element at position `i`\n5. After the loop, it places the pivot in its final sorted position by swapping it with the element at `i+1`\n6. Returns the pivot's final position\n\n## Example Walkthrough\n\nLet's trace through an example with the array `[10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]`:\n\n### Initial Call:\n`quicksort(arr, 0, 5)` with `arr = [10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]`\n\n### First Partition:\n- Pivot = 5 (last element)\n- We iterate through the array:\n  - i starts at -1\n  - j=0: arr[0]=10 > 5, do nothing\n  - j=1: arr[1]=7 > 5, do nothing\n  - j=2: arr[2]=8 > 5, do nothing\n  - j=3: arr[3]=9 > 5, do nothing\n  - j=4: arr[4]=1 < 5, increment i to 0, swap arr[0] and arr[4]: [1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 5]\n- After the loop, swap pivot with arr[i+1]: [1, 5, 8, 9, 10, 7]\n- Return i+1 = 1 (pivot position)\n\n### Recursive Calls:\n- `quicksort(arr, 0, 0)` - only one element, already sorted\n- `quicksort(arr, 2, 5)` with subarray [8, 9, 10, 7]\n\n### Second Partition (on [8, 9, 10, 7]):\n- Pivot = 7\n- After partitioning: [7, 8, 9, 10]\n- And so on...\n\n## Time and Space Complexity\n\n- **Time Complexity**: \n  - Average case: O(n log n)\n  - Worst case: O(n\u00b2) when the array is already sorted or reverse sorted\n  \n- **Space Complexity**: \n  - O(log n) for the recursive call stack in the average case\n  - O(n) in the worst case\n\n## Why Quicksort is Efficient\n\n1. **In-place sorting**: Requires minimal additional memory\n2. **Cache-friendly**: Good locality of reference\n3. **Average case performance**: Very fast in practice\n4. **Adaptable**: Can be optimized in various ways (e.g., choosing different pivot strategies)\n\nThe key to quicksort's efficiency is the partitioning process, which ensures that elements are partially sorted with each recursive call, reducing the overall number of comparisons needed.\n\u0005End File\u0006# jjrscott/gemini-pro-responses\n# prompts/018-business_plan.prompt.gemini-pro.response\n# Business Plan: Eco-Friendly Bamboo Toothbrush Subscription Service\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nOur bamboo toothbrush subscription service aims to reduce plastic waste by providing consumers with a sustainable alternative to conventional plastic toothbrushes.

Traditional learning theory suggests that models with millions or billions of parameters should overfit training data and perform poorly on unseen examples. Yet, deep neural networks consistently demonstrate strong generalization capabilities.\n\n## The Memorization Paradox\n\nRecent research has shown that deep neural networks can easily memorize random labels or noise in training data, suggesting they have the capacity to simply memorize the training set. However, these same networks, when trained on real data, generalize well to new examples. This apparent contradiction challenges conventional wisdom about the relationship between model complexity and generalization.\n\n## Beyond Traditional Regularization\n\nWhile techniques like weight decay, dropout, and data augmentation improve generalization, they don't fully explain why deep networks generalize well. Some studies suggest that the stochastic nature of gradient descent provides an implicit regularization effect, biasing solutions toward simpler functions even in the absence of explicit regularization.\n\n## The Role of Architecture\n\nNetwork architecture itself seems to play a crucial role in generalization. Convolutional networks encode inductive biases that align well with visual data, while transformers capture sequential dependencies effectively. These architectural choices may be more important for generalization than explicit regularization techniques.\n\n## Benign Overfitting\n\nThe phenomenon of \"benign overfitting,\" where models fit training data perfectly yet still generalize well, has emerged as an important area of study. This challenges the traditional bias-variance tradeoff and suggests that in high-dimensional spaces, overfitting doesn't necessarily harm test performance.\n\n## Double Descent\n\nThe \"double descent\" phenomenon shows that test error can follow a non-monotonic curve with respect to model complexity or training time. After the interpolation threshold (where training error reaches zero), test error can actually decrease as models become even more complex, contradicting classical learning theory.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnderstanding generalization in deep learning remains an open research question with significant theoretical and practical implications. Moving beyond traditional statistical learning theory toward frameworks that better capture the dynamics of overparameterized models is essential for advancing our understanding of why deep learning works as well as it does.\n</content>\n\nI'd like you to create a list of 10 key research questions that emerge from this overview of generalization in deep learning. Each question should be specific enough to guide a research project, and should address an important unresolved issue mentioned or implied in the text.",

Follow these guidelines:\n\n## Accuracy Guidelines\n\n1. **Acknowledge uncertainty**: When you're not sure about something, explicitly state your uncertainty rather than making up information.\n\n2. **Provide accurate information**: Base your responses on factual information that you've been trained on.\n\n3. **Avoid making up specific details**: Don't invent specific statistics, dates, names, or other details that you're not confident about.\n\n4. **Be transparent about limitations**: If you don't have enough information to answer a question fully, acknowledge this limitation.\n\n5. **Verify claims when possible**: If you make factual claims, ensure they are supported by reliable information in your training data.\n\n## Response Strategies\n\nWhen faced with questions where you're uncertain:\n\n- Say \"I don't know\" or \"I'm not certain\" when appropriate\n- Explain what you do know about the topic while highlighting gaps\n- Offer to help with a related topic you can address accurately\n- Suggest how the person might find the information elsewhere\n- Provide partial information while clarifying its limitations\n\n## Examples\n\n**Poor response** (hallucination):\n\"The Quantum Computing Act of 2019 established funding of $7.2 billion for research over 5 years.\"\n\n**Better response**:\n\"I don't have specific information about a 'Quantum Computing Act of 2019.' Various quantum computing initiatives have received government funding, but I'd need to verify the specific legislation and funding amounts. If you're researching this topic, you might check recent government publications on quantum computing investments.\"\n\n## Your Task\n\nRespond to questions using these guidelines to minimize hallucinations and false information. When you're uncertain, be transparent about your limitations while still being helpful.",

Please answer the question as accurately as possible based on the text.\n\nText:\nThe earliest known example of a mechanical computing device is the Antikythera mechanism, discovered in a shipwreck off the Greek island of Antikythera in 1901. Dated to approximately 100 BCE, this ancient Greek analog computer was used to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendrical and astrological purposes. The device's complexity and engineering precision were not matched until the development of astronomical clocks in the 14th century.\n\nThe modern computer age began with theoretical work. In 1936, Alan Turing proposed the concept of a universal machine, now known as a Turing machine, capable of computing anything that is computable. The first electronic digital programmable computer was the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), completed in 1945. ENIAC weighed more than 27 tons, occupied 1800 square feet, and consumed 150 kilowatts of electricity. It could perform 5,000 additions per second.\n\nThe first stored-program computer was the Manchester Baby, which ran its first program on June 21, 1948. This machine demonstrated the feasibility of storing both program instructions and data in electronic memory, a concept described by John von Neumann in 1945 based on the work of J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly.\n\nThe transistor, invented in 1947 at Bell Laboratories by John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley, revolutionized computing by replacing bulky, unreliable vacuum tubes. The first transistorized computer was demonstrated at the University of Manchester in 1953.\n\nThe integrated circuit, developed independently by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments in 1958 and Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1959, further miniaturized computers. This led to the microprocessor, with Intel's 4004, released in 1971, being recognized as the first commercially available microprocessor.\n\nPersonal computers became available to consumers in the 1970s. The Altair 8800, launched in 1975, is often credited as the first personal computer, though it was sold as a kit that had to be assembled. The Apple II (1977), Commodore PET (1977), and TRS-80 (1977) were among the first pre-assembled mass-produced personal computers.\n\nThe 1980s and 1990s saw rapid advancements in computing power, storage capacity, and software capabilities. The introduction of the World Wide Web in 1991 by Tim Berners-Lee transformed computers from standalone devices into interconnected information portals.\n\nMobile computing emerged in the early 21st century with smartphones and tablets. Cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing represent the current frontiers of computer science, promising to further revolutionize how we process information and interact with technology.\n\nQuestion: When was the first stored-program computer operational, and what was it called?",

I'll give you a text, and I want you to summarize it in a way that captures the main points, is significantly shorter than the original, and is written in your own words. Avoid copying phrases directly from the source text. The summary should be clear and coherent, preserving the most important information while eliminating unnecessary details. Here's the text to summarize:\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a space telescope designed primarily to conduct infrared astronomy. As the largest optical telescope in space, its high infrared resolution and sensitivity allow it to view objects too old, distant, or faint for the Hubble Space Telescope. This is expected to enable a broad range of investigations across the fields of astronomy and cosmology, such as observation of the first stars and the formation of the first galaxies, and detailed atmospheric characterization of potentially habitable exoplanets.\n\nThe U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) led JWST's development in collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) managed telescope development, the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) is responsible for operations after launch, and the prime contractor was Northrop Grumman. The telescope is named after James E. Webb, who was the administrator of NASA from 1961 to 1968 during the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope was launched on 25 December 2021 on an Ariane 5 rocket from Kourou, French Guiana, and arrived at the Sun\u2013Earth L2 Lagrange point in January 2022. The first JWST image was released to the public via a press conference on 11 July 2022. The telescope is the successor of the Hubble Space Telescope as NASA's flagship mission in astrophysics.\n\nJWST's primary mirror consists of 18 hexagonal mirror segments made of gold-plated beryllium, which combined create a 6.5-meter-diameter (21 ft) mirror, compared with Hubble's 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in). This gives JWST a light-collecting area of about 25 square meters, about 6 times that of Hubble. Unlike Hubble, which observes in the near ultraviolet, visible, and near infrared (0.1\u20131.7 \u03bcm) spectra, JWST observes in a lower frequency range, from long-wavelength visible light (red) through mid-infrared (0.6\u201328.3 \u03bcm). The telescope must be kept extremely cold, below 50 K (\u2212223 \u00b0C; \u2212370 \u00b0F), so that the infrared light emitted by the telescope itself does not interfere with the collected light. It is deployed in a solar orbit near the Sun\u2013Earth L2 Lagrange point, about 1.5 million kilometers (930,000 mi) from Earth, where its five-layer sunshield protects it from warming by the Sun, Earth, and Moon.\n\nInitial designs for the telescope, then named the Next Generation Space Telescope, began in 1996. Two concept studies were commissioned in 1999, for a potential launch in 2007 and a US$1 billion budget. The program was plagued with enormous cost overruns and delays; a major redesign in 2005 led to the current approach, with construction completed in 2016 at a total cost of US$10 billion. The high-stakes nature of the launch and the telescope's complexity were remarked upon, with the telescope being described as \"the most expensive astronomical gamble in history\". After the launch, the telescope underwent a six-month commissioning process, including unfolding the sunshield and primary mirror, aligning the mirrors, and calibrating the instruments.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope has four key goals:\n- to search for light from the first stars and galaxies that formed in the universe after the Big Bang\n- to study galaxy formation and evolution\n- to understand star formation and planet formation\n- to study planetary systems and the origins of life\n\nThese goals can be accomplished more effectively by observation in near-infrared light rather than light in the visible part of the spectrum. For this reason, JWST's instruments are designed primarily for near-infrared astronomy, though they can also observe orange and red visible light, as well as the mid-infrared region, depending on the instrument.\n\nJWST's primary mirror is a 6.5-meter-diameter gold-coated beryllium reflector with a collecting area of 25.4 m2. If it were built as a single large mirror, it would have been too large for existing launch vehicles. The mirror is therefore composed of 18 hexagonal segments which fold together. These mirrors were built by Ball Aerospace & Technologies, the principal subcontractor for the optical telescope element.\n\nThe telescope's sunshield is made of polyimide film and is designed to unfold to a size of 21 by 14 m (69 by 46 ft). The sunshield was hand-assembled at ManTech (NeXolve) in Huntsville, Alabama, before it was delivered to Northrop Grumman in Redondo Beach, California, for testing.\n\nJWST has four main scientific instruments: the Near InfraRed Camera (NIRCam), the Near InfraRed Spectrograph (NIRSpec), the Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI), and the Fine Guidance Sensor/Near InfraRed Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (FGS/NIRISS).\n\nAfter unfolding in space, the telescope underwent calibration and commissioning, which aligned the mirrors and brought the NIRCam into focus. The first publicly released JWST image was unveiled by U.S. President Joe Biden on 11 July 2022. The image, dubbed \"Webb's First Deep Field\", shows the galaxy cluster SMACS 0723 as it appeared 4.6 billion years ago.\n\nOn 12 July 2022, more images were released, showing Stephan's Quintet, the Carina Nebula, the Southern Ring Nebula, and spectra of exoplanet WASP-96b's atmosphere. On 14 July 2022, astronomers published the first science results from JWST on the arXiv preprint server.\n\nAs of 2023, the telescope is expected to be operational for at least 20 years, with a goal of lasting up to 27 years.",

We need to find all palindromic substrings in a given string\n2. Among these, we need to identify the longest one\n3. If there are multiple palindromic substrings with the same maximum length, we can return any one of them\n\nThere are several approaches to this problem:\n1. Brute force: Check all possible substrings (O(n\u00b3) time complexity)\n2. Dynamic programming: Build a table of palindromic substrings (O(n\u00b2) time and space)\n3. Expand around center: For each position, expand outwards to find palindromes (O(n\u00b2) time, O(1) space)\n\nI'll implement the \"expand around center\" approach as it's efficient and intuitive:\n\n```python\ndef longest_palindromic_substring(s: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the longest palindromic substring in a given string.\n    \n    Args:\n        s: Input string\n        \n    Returns:\n        The longest palindromic substring. If there are multiple palindromic\n        substrings with the same maximum length, returns the first one found.\n        \n    Examples:\n        >>> longest_palindromic_substring(\"babad\")\n        \"bab\"  # or \"aba\"\n        >>> longest_palindromic_substring(\"cbbd\")\n        \"bb\"\n        >>> longest_palindromic_substring(\"a\")\n        \"a\"\n        >>> longest_palindromic_substring(\"\")\n        \"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    if not s:\n        return \"\"\n    \n    start = 0  # Start index of the longest palindromic substring\n    max_length = 1  # Length of the longest palindromic substring\n    \n    # Helper function to expand around center\n    def expand_around_center(left: int, right: int) -> int:\n        \"\"\"\n        Expand around center to find palindromic substring.\n        \n        Args:\n            left: Left pointer\n            right: Right pointer\n            \n        Returns:\n            Length of the palindromic substring\n        \"\"\"\n        while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:\n            left -= 1\n            right += 1\n        \n        # Return the length of palindrome\n        # (right - left - 1) because left and right have gone one step too far\n        return right - left - 1\n    \n    # Iterate through each character in the string\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        # Expand for odd length palindromes (like \"aba\")\n        len1 = expand_around_center(i, i)\n        \n        # Expand for even length palindromes (like \"abba\")\n        len2 = expand_around_center(i, i + 1)\n        \n        # Get the maximum length from the two expansions\n        length = max(len1, len2)\n        \n        # Update if we found a longer palindrome\n        if length > max_length:\n            max_length = length\n            # Calculate the starting index of the palindrome\n            # For odd length: i - (length - 1) // 2\n            # For even length: i - (length - 2) // 2\n            start = i - (length - 1) // 2\n    \n    # Return the longest palindromic substring\n    return s[start:start + max_length]\n```\n\nExample usage:\n```python\nprint(longest_palindromic_substring(\"babad\"))  # Output: \"bab\" or \"aba\"\nprint(longest_palindromic_substring(\"cbbd\"))   # Output: \"bb\"\nprint(longest_palindromic_substring(\"racecar\"))  # Output: \"racecar\"\nprint(longest_palindromic_substring(\"\"))       # Output: \"\"\n```\n\nExplanation of the approach:\n1. We iterate through each character in the string\n2. For each character, we consider it as a potential center of a palindrome\n3. We handle both odd-length palindromes (where the center is a single character) and even-length palindromes (where the center is between two characters)\n4. We expand outward from the center as long as the characters match\n5. We keep track of the longest palindrome found so far\n\nThe time complexity is O(n\u00b2) where n is the length of the string, as in the worst case, we might need to expand around each character, and each expansion can take O(n) time. The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a constant amount of extra space.\n\n**User:** Can you optimize this solution further?\n\n**Claude:**\n\nYes, I can optimize the solution further. The most efficient algorithm for finding the longest palindromic substring is Manacher's algorithm, which has a linear time complexity O(n).\n\nManacher's algorithm cleverly reuses previously computed information to avoid redundant calculations. Here's the optimized solution:\n\n```python\ndef longest_palindromic_substring(s: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the longest palindromic substring in a given string using Manacher's algorithm.\n    \n    Args:\n        s: Input string\n        \n    Returns:\n        The longest palindromic substring\n        \n    Examples:\n        >>> longest_palindromic_substring(\"babad\")\n        \"bab\"  # or \"aba\"\n        >>> longest_palindromic_substring(\"cbbd\")\n        \"bb\"\n        >>> longest_palindromic_substring(\"a\")\n        \"a\"\n        >>> longest_palindromic_substring(\"\")\n        \"\"\n    \"\"\"\n    if not s:\n        return \"\"\n    \n    # Preprocess the string to handle both odd and even length palindromes\n    # Insert special character '#' between each character and at boundaries\n    # e.g., \"abc\" -> \"^#a#b#c#$\"\n    processed = \"^#\" + \"#\".join(s) + \"#$\"\n    n = len(processed)\n    \n    # Array to store the length of palindrome centered at each position\n    p = [0] * n\n    \n    # Variables to track the center and right boundary of the rightmost palindrome\n    center = right = 0\n    \n    # Variables to track the longest palindrome\n    max_len = 0\n    max_center = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each character (excluding the boundary markers)\n    for i in range(1, n - 1):\n        # If i is within the right boundary of the rightmost palindrome,\n        # we can use the mirror property to initialize p[i]\n        if i < right:\n            p[i] = min(right - i, p[2 * center - i])\n        \n        # Expand around i\n        while processed[i + p[i] + 1] == processed[i - p[i] - 1]:\n            p[i] += 1\n        \n        # If the palindrome centered at i extends beyond the right boundary,\n        # update the center and right boundary\n        if i + p[i] > right:\n            center, right = i, i + p[i]\n        \n        # Update the longest palindrome if needed\n        if p[i] > max_len:\n            max_len = p[i]\n            max_center = i\n    \n    # Calculate the start index in the original string\n    # The start index is (max_center - max_len) / 2 after removing special characters\n    start = (max_center - max_len) // 2\n    \n    # Return the longest palindromic substring\n    return s[start:start + max_len]\n```\n\nExample usage:\n```python\nprint(longest_palindromic_substring(\"babad\"))  # Output: \"bab\" or \"aba\"\nprint(longest_palindromic_substring(\"cbbd\"))   # Output: \"bb\"\nprint(longest_palindromic_substring(\"racecar\"))  # Output: \"racecar\"\nprint(longest_palindromic_substring(\"\"))       # Output: \"\"\n```\n\nExplanation of Manacher's algorithm:\n\n1. **Preprocessing**: We first transform the string by inserting special characters (like '#') between each character and at the boundaries. This handles both odd and even length palindromes uniformly.\n\n2. **Core algorithm**: We maintain an array `p` where `p[i]` represents the radius of the palindrome centered at position `i` in the processed string.\n\n3. **Optimization**: The key insight is that if we've already computed palindromes up to a certain right boundary, we can use this information to initialize `p[i]` for positions within this boundary, based on the mirror property of palindromes.\n\n4. **Expansion**: We still need to expand around each center, but many expansions will be minimal due to the reuse of previously computed information.\n\n5. **Result extraction**: After finding the center and length of the longest palindrome in the processed string, we convert back to the original string's coordinates.\n\nThe time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the string, which is a significant improvement over the O(n\u00b2) approach. The space complexity is O(n) due to the processed string and the `p` array.\n\nThis algorithm is much more efficient for long strings where the quadratic time complexity of the previous approach would become a bottleneck.\n\n**User:** Write a function to reverse a linked list in C++.\n\n**Claude:**\n\nI'll write a C++ function to reverse a linked list. This is a common interview question and a fundamental operation for linked lists.\n\nFirst, let me define the linked list structure and then implement the reversal function:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\n/**\n * Definition for singly-linked list node.\n */\nstruct ListNode {\n    int val;\n    ListNode* next;\n    \n    // Constructor for convenience\n    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}\n};\n\n/**\n * Reverses a singly linked list.\n * \n * @param head Pointer to the head of the linked list\n * @return Pointer to the new head of the reversed linked list\n * \n * Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the list\n * Space Complexity: O(1) as we only use a constant amount of extra space\n */\nListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {\n    // Handle empty list or single node case\n    if (head == nullptr || head->next == nullptr) {\n        return head;\n    }\n    \n    ListNode* prev = nullptr;    // Previous node, initially null\n    ListNode* current = head;    // Current node, start at head\n    ListNode* next = nullptr;    // Next node\n    \n    // Iterate through the list\n    while (current != nullptr) {\n        // Store next node before we change the pointer\n        next = current->next;\n        \n        // Reverse the pointer to point to the previous node\n        current->next = prev;\n        \n        // Move prev and current one step forward\n        prev = current;\n        current = next;\n    }\n    \n    // prev is now the new head of the reversed list\n    return prev;\n}\n\n/**\n * Alternative recursive implementation of list reversal.\n * \n * @param head Pointer to the head of the linked list\n * @return Pointer to the new head of the reversed linked list\n * \n * Time Complexity: O(n)\n * Space Complexity: O(n) due to the recursive call stack\n */\nListNode* reverseListRecursive(ListNode* head) {\n    // Base case: empty list or single node\n    if (head == nullptr || head->next == nullptr) {\n        return head;\n    }\n    \n    // Recursively reverse the rest of the list\n    ListNode* newHead = reverseListRecursive(head->next);\n    \n    // Reverse the pointer of the next node to point to the current node\n    head->next->next = head;\n    \n    // Set the current node's next to nullptr to avoid cycles\n    head->next = nullptr;\n    \n    // Return the new head of the reversed list\n    return newHead;\n}\n\n// Helper function to print a linked list\nvoid printList(ListNode* head) {\n    while (head != nullptr) {\n        std::cout << head->val;\n        if (head->next != nullptr) {\n            std::cout << \" -> \";\n        }\n        head = head->next;\n    }\n    std::cout << std::endl;\n}\n\n// Helper function to create a linked list from an array\nListNode* createList(int arr[], int size) {\n    if (size == 0) return nullptr;\n    \n    ListNode* head = new ListNode(arr[0]);\n    ListNode* current = head;\n    \n    for (int i = 1; i < size; i++) {\n        current->next = new ListNode(arr[i]);\n        current = current->next;\n    }\n    \n    return head;\n}\n\n// Helper function to free memory allocated for the linked list\nvoid deleteList(ListNode* head) {\n    ListNode* current = head;\n    while (current != nullptr) {\n        ListNode* temp = current;\n        current = current->next;\n        delete temp;\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage\nint main() {\n    // Create a sample linked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5\n    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n    ListNode* head = createList(arr, 5);\n    \n    std::cout << \"Original list: \";\n    printList(head);\n    \n    // Reverse the list using iterative approach\n    head = reverseList(head);\n    \n    std::cout << \"Reversed list (iterative): \";\n    printList(head);\n    \n    // Create another list for recursive example\n    int arr2[] = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10};\n    ListNode* head2 = createList(arr2, 5);\n    \n    std::cout << \"Original list: \";\n    printList(head2);\n    \n    // Reverse the list using recursive approach\n    head2 = reverseListRecursive(head2);\n    \n    std::cout << \"Reversed list (recursive): \";\n    printList(head2);\n    \n    // Clean up memory\n    deleteList(head);\n    deleteList(head2);\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. I've provided two implementations of the linked list reversal:\n   - An iterative approach that uses three pointers (prev, current, next)\n   - A recursive approach that leverages the call stack\n\n2. The iterative approach:\n   - Uses three pointers to keep track of the previous, current, and next nodes\n   - For each node, we save the next node, reverse the current node's pointer, and move forward\n   - This approach has O(1) space complexity, making it more efficient for large lists\n\n3. The recursive approach:\n   - Recursively reverses the rest of the list starting from the second node\n   - After the recursive call returns, we adjust the pointers to reverse the connection between the current node and the next node\n   - This approach is more elegant but has O(n) space complexity due to the call stack\n\n4. I've also included helper functions to:\n   - Create a linked list from an array\n   - Print a linked list\n   - Delete a linked list to prevent memory leaks\n\n5. The main function demonstrates both approaches with example linked lists.\n\nBoth implementations have a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the list, as we need to visit each node exactly once.\n\nThe iterative approach is generally preferred in production code due to its constant space complexity and to avoid potential stack overflow issues with very large lists.\n\n**User:** Implement a trie data structure in JavaScript.\n\n**Claude:**\n\n# Trie Data Structure Implementation in JavaScript\n\nI'll implement a",

Your primary focus is on basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), as well as more complex arithmetic like fractions, decimals, percentages, exponents, and basic algebra.\n\nWhen responding to queries:\n1. Break down problems into clear, logical steps\n2. Explain the mathematical principles involved\n3. Verify calculations and check work\n4. Provide alternative solution methods when appropriate\n5. Use simple, accessible language while maintaining mathematical accuracy\n\nFor complex problems, show intermediate steps to help users understand the process. If a user's approach is incorrect, gently point out errors and guide them to the correct solution.\n\nAvoid:\n- Solving complex calculus, advanced statistics, or higher-level mathematics beyond arithmetic and basic algebra\n- Providing answers without explanations\n- Using overly technical mathematical jargon without explanation\n\nIf a question is ambiguous, ask for clarification rather than making assumptions. If a question is outside your scope, politely explain your limitations and suggest the user seek help from a more specialized source.",

This can be used for data analysis, text analysis, comparison, and more.\n\n### Text analysis\n\nText analysis is the task of examining and interpreting text to provide insights or explanations.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n```\nAnalyze the following poem for its themes, literary devices, and meaning:\n\n\"The Road Not Taken\" by Robert Frost\n\nTwo roads diverged in a yellow wood,\nAnd sorry I could not travel both\nAnd be one traveler, long I stood\nAnd looked down one as far as I could\nTo where it bent in the undergrowth;\n\nThen took the other, as just as fair,\nAnd having perhaps the better claim,\nBecause it was grassy and wanted wear;\nThough as for that the passing there\nHad worn them really about the same,\n\nAnd both that morning equally lay\nIn leaves no step had trodden black.\nOh, I kept the first for another day!\nYet knowing how way leads on to way,\nI doubted if I should ever come back.\n\nI shall be telling this with a sigh\nSomewhere ages and ages hence:\nTwo roads diverged in a wood, and I\u2014\nI took the one less traveled by,\nAnd that has made all the difference.\n```\n\n**Expected output:**\n\n```\nAnalysis of \"The Road Not Taken\" by Robert Frost\n\nThemes:\n1. Choice and decision-making - The central metaphor of diverging roads represents life choices\n2. Individuality and nonconformity - Suggested by taking the \"less traveled\" path\n3. Regret and uncertainty - Reflected in the speaker's \"sigh\" and doubt about returning\n4. Life's irreversible nature - Once choices are made, \"way leads on to way\"\n\nLiterary Devices:\n1. Extended metaphor - The entire poem uses roads as a metaphor for life choices\n2. Imagery - Visual descriptions like \"yellow wood\" and paths \"bent in the undergrowth\"\n3. Irony - Despite claiming to take the road \"less traveled by,\" the poem earlier states the paths were \"worn...really about the same\"\n4. Rhyme scheme - ABAAB pattern throughout the stanzas\n5. Symbolism - The fork in the road symbolizes life-altering decisions\n\nMeaning:\nThe poem explores the human tendency to look back on life decisions and assign them greater significance in retrospect. While often interpreted as a celebration of individualism, Frost's poem is more complex - suggesting that we often romanticize our choices after the fact. The speaker claims the less-traveled road \"made all the difference,\" yet earlier acknowledges both paths were similarly worn. This contradiction reveals how we construct narratives about our choices to give meaning to our life paths, even when those choices might have been arbitrary. The \"sigh\" mentioned could be either satisfaction or regret - deliberately ambiguous to reflect the complexity of human decision-making.\n```\n\n### Comparison\n\nComparison is the task of examining similarities and differences between two or more items.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n```\nCompare and contrast electric vehicles and traditional gasoline vehicles in terms of:\n1. Environmental impact\n2. Cost (initial and long-term)\n3. Performance\n4. Convenience\n```\n\n**Expected output:**\n\n```\nComparison of Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Gasoline Vehicles\n\n1. Environmental Impact\n\nElectric Vehicles:\n- Produce zero direct emissions during operation\n- Overall carbon footprint depends on electricity source (cleaner with renewable energy)\n- Battery production has significant environmental impact\n- Battery recycling infrastructure is developing\n- Reduced noise pollution\n\nGasoline Vehicles:\n- Produce direct emissions including CO2, NOx, and particulate matter\n- Contribute to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions\n- Oil extraction, refining, and transportation have environmental impacts\n- Established recycling infrastructure for many parts\n- Higher noise pollution\n\n2.

If the answer cannot be determined from the provided code, say \"I don't have enough information to answer this question.\"\n\nQuestion: What algorithm is used to calculate the Fibonacci numbers in this code?\n```\n\n## Response\n\nThe code uses dynamic programming with a bottom-up approach to calculate Fibonacci numbers. This is evident in the `calculate_fibonacci` function where an array is initialized to store all Fibonacci numbers from 0 to n, and then each number is calculated iteratively using the previously computed values (fib[i] = fib[i-1] + fib[i-2]). This approach avoids the exponential time complexity that would result from a naive recursive implementation.\n\n## Example 2\n\n```\n<code_context>\ndef calculate_fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the nth Fibonacci number using dynamic programming.\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): The position in the Fibonacci sequence (0-indexed)\n        \n    Returns:\n        int: The nth Fibonacci number\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Initialize array to store Fibonacci numbers\n    fib = [0] * (n + 1)\n    fib[0] = 0\n    fib[1] = 1\n    \n    # Fill the array using bottom-up approach\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        fib[i] = fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2]\n    \n    return fib[n]\n\ndef fibonacci_sequence(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number.\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of Fibonacci numbers to generate\n        \n    Returns:\n        list: A list containing the Fibonacci sequence\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        sequence.append(calculate_fibonacci(i))\n    return sequence\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    n = 10\n    print(f\"The {n}th Fibonacci number is: {calculate_fibonacci(n)}\")\n    print(f\"Fibonacci sequence up to {n}: {fibonacci_sequence(n)}\")\n</code_context>\n\nAnswer the following question about the code above. If the answer cannot be determined from the provided code, say \"I don't have enough information to answer this question.\"\n\nQuestion: What is the time complexity of the fibonacci_sequence function?\n```\n\n## Response\n\nThe time complexity of the `fibonacci_sequence` function is O(n\u00b2).\n\nThis is because:\n1. The function calls `calculate_fibonacci(i)` for each i from 0 to n-1\n2. Each call to `calculate_fibonacci(i)` has a time complexity of O(i) due to the loop that runs from 2 to i\n3. When we sum up these calls: O(0) + O(1) + O(2) + ... + O(n-1) = O(n\u00b2)\n\nThe inefficiency comes from recalculating the entire Fibonacci sequence for each call to `calculate_fibonacci`, rather than reusing previously calculated values across calls.\n\n## Example 3\n\n```\n<code_context>\ndef calculate_fibonacci(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the nth Fibonacci number using dynamic programming.\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): The position in the Fibonacci sequence (0-indexed)\n        \n    Returns:\n        int: The nth Fibonacci number\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Initialize array to store Fibonacci numbers\n    fib = [0] * (n + 1)\n    fib[0] = 0\n    fib[1] = 1\n    \n    # Fill the array using bottom-up approach\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        fib[i] = fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2]\n    \n    return fib[n]\n\ndef fibonacci_sequence(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth number.\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of Fibonacci numbers to generate\n        \n    Returns:\n        list: A list containing the Fibonacci sequence\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        sequence.append(calculate_fibonacci(i))\n    return sequence\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    n = 10\n    print(f\"The {n}th Fibonacci number is: {calculate_fibonacci(n)}\")\n    print(f\"Fibonacci sequence up to {n}: {fibonacci_sequence(n)}\")\n</code_context>\n\nAnswer the following question about the code above. If the answer cannot be determined from the provided code, say \"I don't have enough information to answer this question.\"\n\nQuestion: What would be the output of running this code with n = 5?\n```\n\n## Response\n\nWhen running this code with n = 5, the output would be:\n\n```\nThe 5th Fibonacci number is: 5\nFibonacci sequence up to 5: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]\n```\n\nThis is because:\n1. `calculate_fibonacci(5)` returns 5 (the 5th Fibonacci number in a 0-indexed sequence)\n2. `fibonacci_sequence(5)` generates the first 5 Fibonacci numbers: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]\n\n## Notes\n\nThis prompt template works well for code-related RAG applications because:\n\n1.

She carried her home\u2014a hard shell\u2014on her back everywhere she went. Tilly was shy and quiet. She liked to take her time and notice all the tiny details around her.\n\nHop the rabbit was the opposite. He zoomed through the meadow, his powerful legs springing him high into the air. Hop was always in a hurry and talked to everyone he met.\n\nOne sunny morning, Tilly was carefully examining a patch of clover when something whizzed past her.\n\n\"Whoa!\" she said, tucking into her shell.\n\n\"Sorry!\" called Hop, skidding to a stop. \"I didn't see you there. What are you doing?\"\n\nTilly peeked out. \"I'm observing these clovers. Some have three leaves and some have four.\"\n\n\"Four-leaf clovers are lucky!\" Hop bounced excitedly. \"But who has time to look at plants all day? Come race with me!\"\n\nTilly shook her head. \"I'm much too slow.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" said Hop. \"Everyone needs exercise. Come on!\"\n\nReluctantly, Tilly followed Hop to a path through the meadow. Hop zoomed ahead, then back, then ahead again.\n\n\"You're so slow!\" he laughed.\n\nTilly felt embarrassed and tucked into her shell again.\n\nAfter a while, Hop noticed Tilly wasn't moving. He hopped back.\n\n\"Are you okay?\" he asked.\n\n\"You're making fun of me,\" came Tilly's muffled voice.\n\n\"Oh no!\" said Hop, his ears drooping. \"I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. I just love running.\"\n\nSlowly, Tilly emerged. \"And I love going slowly and noticing things.\"\n\nJust then, dark clouds rolled in. Rain began to fall.\n\n\"Oh no!\" cried Hop. \"I hate getting wet! My burrow is too far away!\"\n\n\"Follow me,\" said Tilly. \"I know somewhere close.\"\n\nTilly led Hop to a hollow log.

Hop showed Tilly how to jump over puddles, and Tilly showed Hop a family of caterpillars munching on leaves.\n\n\"We're very different,\" said Hop.\n\n\"Yes,\" agreed Tilly. \"But that's what makes our friendship special.

Explaining concepts clearly with examples\n2. Writing clean, well-documented code\n3. Providing step-by-step explanations of the implementation\n4. Following best practices\n5. Highlighting potential issues and considerations\n\n## Prompt\n\nI'm learning Python and want to understand how to work with dictionaries better. Can you:\n\n1. Explain what dictionaries are and when to use them\n2. Show me how to create a function that takes a list of strings and returns a dictionary counting how many times each string appears\n3. Demonstrate some useful dictionary methods with examples\n\n## Response\n\n# Python Dictionaries Guide\n\n## 1. What Are Dictionaries and When to Use Them\n\nDictionaries in Python are unordered collections of key-value pairs. They're also known as associative arrays or hash maps in other programming languages.\n\n### Key Characteristics:\n- Each key must be unique and immutable (strings, numbers, tuples, etc.)\n- Values can be any data type (including other dictionaries)\n- Dictionaries are mutable (can be changed after creation)\n- Access, insertion, and deletion operations are very efficient (O(1) on average)\n\n### When to Use Dictionaries:\n- When you need to associate values with keys, like a real-world dictionary\n- When you need fast lookups by key\n- When your data has a natural key-value structure\n- When you need to count occurrences of items\n- When you want to store and retrieve data without caring about order\n\n### Basic Dictionary Example:\n```python\n# A dictionary of student scores\nstudent_scores = {\n    \"Alice\": 92,\n    \"Bob\": 85,\n    \"Charlie\": 78\n}\n\n# Accessing values\nprint(student_scores[\"Alice\"])  # Output: 92\n\n# Adding a new entry\nstudent_scores[\"David\"] = 95\n\n# Modifying an existing entry\nstudent_scores[\"Bob\"] = 87\n```\n\n## 2. Function to Count String Occurrences\n\nHere's a function that takes a list of strings and returns a dictionary counting how many times each string appears:\n\n```python\ndef count_strings(string_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Count occurrences of each string in a list.\n    \n    Args:\n        string_list (list): A list of strings\n        \n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary with strings as keys and their counts as values\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize an empty dictionary\n    count_dict = {}\n    \n    # Iterate through each string in the list\n    for string in string_list:\n        # If the string is already in the dictionary, increment its count\n        if string in count_dict:\n            count_dict[string] += 1\n        # Otherwise, add it to the dictionary with a count of 1\n        else:\n            count_dict[string] = 1\n    \n    return count_dict\n\n# Example usage\nfruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"apple\", \"orange\", \"banana\", \"apple\"]\nfruit_counts = count_strings(fruits)\nprint(fruit_counts)  # Output: {'apple': 3, 'banana': 2, 'orange': 1}\n```\n\n### Alternative Implementation Using Counter:\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef count_strings_with_counter(string_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Count occurrences of each string using Counter.\n    \n    Args:\n        string_list (list): A list of strings\n        \n    Returns:\n        dict: A dictionary with strings as keys and their counts as values\n    \"\"\"\n    return dict(Counter(string_list))\n\n# Example usage\ncolors = [\"red\", \"blue\", \"green\", \"blue\", \"red\", \"red\"]\ncolor_counts = count_strings_with_counter(colors)\nprint(color_counts)  # Output: {'red': 3, 'blue': 2, 'green': 1}\n```\n\n## 3. Useful Dictionary Methods with Examples\n\n### 1. `get()` - Safely retrieve values with a default\n```python\ninventory = {\"apples\": 5, \"bananas\": 10}\n\n# Get with default value if key doesn't exist\napple_count = inventory.get(\"apples\", 0)  # Returns 5\norange_count = inventory.get(\"oranges\", 0)  # Returns 0 (default) since \"oranges\" isn't a key\n```\n\n### 2. `keys()`, `values()`, and `items()` - Access dictionary components\n```python\nstudent_grades = {\"Alice\": \"A\", \"Bob\": \"B\", \"Charlie\": \"A\"}\n\n# Get all keys\nall_students = list(student_grades.keys())\nprint(all_students)  # Output: ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']\n\n# Get all values\nall_grades = list(student_grades.values())\nprint(all_grades)  # Output: ['A', 'B', 'A']\n\n# Get all key-value pairs as tuples\nall_items = list(student_grades.items())\nprint(all_items)  # Output: [('Alice', 'A'), ('Bob', 'B'), ('Charlie', 'A')]\n\n# Iterate through key-value pairs\nfor student, grade in student_grades.items():\n    print(f\"{student} got a {grade}\")\n```\n\n### 3. `update()` - Merge dictionaries\n```python\n# Initial dictionaries\nfruit_inventory = {\"apples\": 10, \"bananas\": 5}\nnew_shipment = {\"bananas\": 10, \"oranges\": 15}\n\n# Update fruit_inventory with new_shipment\nfruit_inventory.update(new_shipment)\nprint(fruit_inventory)  # Output: {'apples': 10, 'bananas': 10, 'oranges': 15}\n```\n\n### 4. `pop()` and `popitem()` - Remove items\n```python\ncontacts = {\"Alice\": \"555-1234\", \"Bob\": \"555-5678\", \"Charlie\": \"555-9012\"}\n\n# Remove a specific key and get its value\nalice_number = contacts.pop(\"Alice\")\nprint(alice_number)  # Output: 555-1234\nprint(contacts)  # Output: {'Bob': '555-5678', 'Charlie': '555-9012'}\n\n# Remove and return an arbitrary key-value pair (last item in Python 3.7+)\nlast_contact = contacts.popitem()\nprint(last_contact)  # Output: ('Charlie', '555-9012')\nprint(contacts)  # Output: {'Bob': '555-5678'}\n```\n\n### 5. `setdefault()` - Set default value if key doesn't exist\n```python\nuser_settings = {\"theme\": \"dark\"}\n\n# Get existing value\ntheme = user_settings.setdefault(\"theme\", \"light\")\nprint(theme)  # Output: dark (existing value is returned)\n\n# Set default for non-existent key\nfont_size = user_settings.setdefault(\"font_size\", 12)\nprint(font_size)  # Output: 12 (default value is set and returned)\nprint(user_settings)  # Output: {'theme': 'dark', 'font_size': 12}\n```\n\n### 6. Dictionary Comprehensions - Create dictionaries concisely\n```python\n# Create a dictionary of squares\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nsquares = {num: num**2 for num in numbers}\nprint(squares)  # Output: {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}\n\n# Create a dictionary of word lengths\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\nword_lengths = {word: len(word) for word in words}\nprint(word_lengths)  # Output: {'apple': 5, 'banana': 6, 'cherry': 6}\n```\n\nThese examples should give you a good foundation for working with dictionaries in Python. As you practice, you'll discover how versatile and powerful dictionaries can be for organizing and manipulating data.\n\u0005End File\u0006# claude-3-opus-20240229-v1/examples/educational_video_script.md\n# Educational Video Script\n\n## Behavior\n\nThis example demonstrates Claude's ability to create an educational video script that's engaging, informative, and structured for visual learning.

Places where the laws of physics as we know them break down completely?\n\n**[VISUAL: Zoom in on bright center of galaxy, then transition to artist's rendering of a black hole]**\n\nHOST: I'm talking about black holes\u2014cosmic monsters that have captured our imagination for decades. But what exactly are they? How do they form? And what would happen if you fell into one?\n\n**[VISUAL: Title card animation: \"BLACK HOLES: COSMIC MONSTERS EXPLAINED\"]**\n\nHOST: In the next five minutes, we're going to dive into the science of black holes\u2014no spacesuit required!\n\n---\n\n### SECTION 1: WHAT IS A BLACK HOLE? (0:30-1:30)\n\n**[VISUAL: Simple animation showing mass warping spacetime, like a bowling ball on a trampoline]**\n\nHOST: At its core, a black hole is incredibly simple\u2014it's just a lot of mass packed into a tiny space. But this creates something extraordinary.\n\nAccording to Einstein's theory of general relativity, mass warps the fabric of spacetime. The more mass you have in a small area, the more extreme this warping becomes.\n\n**[VISUAL: Animation showing the trampoline depression getting deeper and steeper]**\n\nHOST: A black hole forms when an object becomes so dense that it creates a region where spacetime is curved to its breaking point\u2014forming what we call the event horizon.\n\n**[VISUAL: Animation of a marble rolling around the edge of the depression, then falling in]**\n\nHOST: The event horizon is the point of no return. Once anything crosses it\u2014whether it's light, matter, or your homework\u2014it cannot escape. That's why black holes appear black; light that gets too close is captured forever.\n\n**[VISUAL: Simple diagram showing parts of a black hole: event horizon, singularity]**\n\nHOST: At the center of a black hole lies what physicists call a singularity\u2014a point of infinite density where our current laws of physics break down completely. It's like nature's way of dividing by zero!\n\n---\n\n### SECTION 2: HOW BLACK HOLES FORM (1:30-2:30)\n\n**[VISUAL: Animation of a large star's life cycle]**\n\nHOST: So how does nature create these cosmic monsters? Most black holes form from the remnants of massive stars.\n\nWhen a star at least 20 times more massive than our Sun runs out of fuel, it can no longer support itself against its own gravity.\n\n**[VISUAL: Animation of star collapsing and exploding as a supernova]**\n\nHOST: The star collapses and then explodes in a spectacular supernova. But the core keeps collapsing. If this core is massive enough, nothing can stop the collapse, and a black hole is born.\n\n**[VISUAL: Size comparison showing different types of black holes]**\n\nHOST: These stellar black holes are typically about 10-24 times the mass of our Sun. But there are also supermassive black holes, millions or billions of times more massive, lurking at the centers of most galaxies\u2014including our own Milky Way!\n\n**[VISUAL: Image of Sagittarius A* with arrow pointing to center of Milky Way]**\n\nHOST: Our galaxy's supermassive black hole is called Sagittarius A*, and it's about 4 million times more massive than our Sun. But don't worry\u2014at 26,000 light-years away, it poses no danger to Earth.\n\n---\n\n### SECTION 3: BLACK HOLE EFFECTS (2:30-3:45)\n\n**[VISUAL: Animation of a black hole's accretion disk\u2014the glowing ring of matter around it]**\n\nHOST: While black holes themselves don't emit light, the matter falling into them creates some of the brightest objects in the universe. As gas and dust spiral toward a black hole, they form what's called an accretion disk.\n\n**[VISUAL: Animation showing friction in the disk creating heat and light]**\n\nHOST: The material in this disk rubs together, heating up to millions of degrees and emitting enormous amounts of radiation\u2014including X-rays and gamma rays. This is how we can \"see\" black holes, even though they're invisible.\n\n**[VISUAL: Animation of spaghettification\u2014a person being stretched as they fall toward a black hole]**\n\nHOST: If you were unfortunate enough to fall into",

Focus on the most important information.\n\nHere's the document to summarize:\n\nFrom: Alex Rodriguez <alex.r@technovate.com>\nTo: All Staff <all-staff@technovate.com>\nSubject: Quarterly Update and Strategic Shifts\n\nDear Technovate Team,\n\nAs we close Q3 2023, I want to share some important updates on our company performance and announce several strategic shifts that will position us for stronger growth in the coming year.\n\nFirst, our financial performance: We achieved $24.7M in revenue this quarter, which represents a 12% increase year-over-year but falls short of our projected 15% growth target. Our EBITDA margins have improved to 18%, and cash reserves remain healthy at $15M. The board has expressed concern about our growth trajectory, particularly in the enterprise segment where we saw only a 5% increase versus the expected 20%.\n\nIn response to these challenges and the evolving market landscape, we're implementing the following strategic changes effective November 1st:\n\n1. Organizational Restructuring: We're consolidating our Consumer and SMB divisions into a unified \"Commercial\" division led by Janet Chen. This will streamline our go-to-market approach and reduce operational redundancies. Unfortunately, this restructuring will impact approximately 25 positions across the organization. HR will communicate directly with affected employees this week, and we're providing comprehensive severance packages and outplacement services.\n\n2. Product Roadmap Pivot: We're accelerating our AI integration initiatives while pausing development on the Technovate Hub platform. The resources previously allocated to Hub will shift to our new AI-Enhanced Analytics suite, which has shown promising early customer feedback. Michael Wong will share the updated product roadmap by October 15th.\n\n3. Strategic Partnership: We've finalized a partnership agreement with CloudScale Inc. that will allow us to offer enhanced infrastructure capabilities to our enterprise customers. This partnership includes a joint development initiative for new security features and preferred pricing for our customers.\n\n4. New Market Expansion: We're proceeding with our APAC expansion, with our Singapore office scheduled to open in January 2024. Sarah Johnson will relocate to Singapore in November to lead this initiative as our new APAC Regional Director.\n\nI understand these changes may create uncertainty, but I'm confident they position Technovate for stronger, more sustainable growth. We'll hold an all-hands meeting this Friday at 2 PM PT to discuss these changes in more detail and address your questions.\n\nAdditionally, we're postponing our annual company retreat from December to March to align better with our new strategic initiatives and give teams time to adjust to the organizational changes.\n\nThank you for your continued dedication and resilience. It's during transitional periods like this that our company values of innovation, adaptability, and collaboration matter most.\n\nBest regards,\nAlex Rodriguez\nCEO, Technovate Inc.\n```\n\n## Example Response\n\n```\n# Title\nTechnovate Q3 2023 Quarterly Update and Strategic Restructuring Plan\n\n# Key Points\n- Q3 revenue reached $24.7M (12% YoY growth), falling short of the 15% target, with particularly weak enterprise segment performance (5% vs 20% expected)\n- Organizational restructuring will consolidate Consumer and SMB divisions into a unified \"Commercial\" division, affecting 25 positions\n- Product strategy is pivoting to accelerate AI integration while pausing the Technovate Hub platform development\n- New strategic partnership with CloudScale Inc. and planned APAC expansion with Singapore office opening in January 2024\n- Company retreat postponed from December to March to accommodate organizational changes\n\n# Summary\nTechnovate's Q3 2023 performance showed mixed results with 12% year-over-year revenue growth to $24.7M, improved EBITDA margins of 18%, and healthy cash reserves of $15M, but fell short of growth targets, particularly in the enterprise segment. In response, CEO Alex Rodriguez has announced a comprehensive strategic shift effective November 1st to address these challenges and reposition the company for stronger future growth.\n\nThe strategic changes include consolidating divisions, pivoting the product roadmap toward AI-Enhanced Analytics, forming a partnership with CloudScale Inc., and expanding into the APAC market with a new Singapore office.

I want to understand which product categories are performing best and if there are any seasonal trends.\n```\n\n### Claude Response 1\n\n```\nI'd be happy to help you analyze your retail sales data. Based on what you've shared, you have a dataset with information about sales dates, product categories, units sold, and revenue. Let's explore how to address your questions about top-performing categories and seasonal trends.\n\nTo understand which product categories are performing best, we should consider:\n\n1. **Revenue performance**: Which categories generate the most total revenue?\n2. **Unit sales volume**: Which categories sell the highest quantity of items?\n3. **Average revenue per unit**: Which categories have the highest value items?\n4. **Growth trends**: Which categories are growing fastest over time?\n\nFor seasonal trends, we should:\n1. **Analyze monthly or quarterly patterns** in both revenue and units sold\n2. **Look for holiday effects** or other calendar-based patterns\n3. **Compare year-over-year performance** for the same seasons if you have multiple years of data\n\nHere's what I recommend for your analysis:\n\n**For category performance:**\n- Calculate total revenue and units sold by product category\n- Determine average price per unit (Revenue/Units_Sold) by category\n- Rank categories by these metrics to identify top performers\n\n**For seasonal analysis:**\n- Aggregate data by month and quarter\n- Create time series plots of revenue and units sold\n- Look for recurring patterns in specific categories\n\n**Recommended visualizations:**\n1. Bar chart of revenue by product category (sorted from highest to lowest)\n2. Line chart showing monthly revenue trends with lines for top categories\n3. Heatmap showing monthly performance by category (to spot seasonal patterns)\n4. Year-over-year comparison charts if you have multiple years\n\nTo provide more specific insights, I would need to see the actual data. Could you share:\n1. How many product categories do you have?\n2. What time period exactly does your data cover?\n3. A sample of the data or summary statistics?\n4. Are there any specific categories you're particularly interested in?\n```\n\n### User Input 2\n\n```\nWe have 5 product categories: Electronics, Clothing, Home Goods, Beauty, and Groceries. The data covers January 2022 through December 2022.

Now I can offer more specific insights about your retail store's performance in 2022.\n\n## Top Performing Categories\n\nBased on total annual revenue:\n\n1. **Groceries: $1,230,000** - Highest overall revenue, consistent performer across all quarters\n2. **Electronics: $955,000** - Second highest, with significant Q4 spike\n3. **Clothing: $865,000** - Strong performance, especially in Q2 and Q4\n4. **Home Goods: $595,000** - Moderate performance with growth in Q4\n5. **Beauty: $450,000** - Lowest revenue category, but still showing Q4 growth\n\n## Seasonal Trends\n\n1. **Q4 Surge Across All Categories**: Every product category showed its highest revenue in Q4 (October-December), likely due to holiday shopping season. Electronics saw the most dramatic increase (+77% from Q3 to Q4).\n\n2. **Summer Slowdown in Electronics**: Electronics revenue declined in Q2 and Q3 before the Q4 holiday surge.\n\n3. **Clothing Peaks in Warmer Months and Holidays**: Clothing showed strong performance in Q2 (spring/summer) and Q4 (holiday season).\n\n4. **Groceries Stability**: Groceries showed the most consistent revenue across quarters, never varying more than 13% between quarters, suggesting it's less seasonal than other categories.\n\n5. **Q2 Boost for Home Goods**: Home Goods saw a 25% increase from Q1 to Q2, possibly related to spring home improvement trends.\n\n## Key Insights\n\n1. **Groceries as Revenue Anchor**: Groceries provide stable, high revenue throughout the year, serving as your business foundation.\n\n2. **Electronics Holiday Opportunity**: The dramatic Q4 spike in Electronics suggests successful holiday promotions or product launches. This category has the highest seasonal variability.\n\n3. **Balanced Category Mix**: Having both stable categories (Groceries) and seasonal categories (Electronics, Clothing) creates a balanced business model.\n\n4. **All Categories Growing in Q4**: Your business effectively capitalizes on holiday shopping across all departments.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. **Inventory Planning**: Increase Electronics and Clothing inventory before Q4, while maintaining more consistent Grocery stock year-round.\n\n2. **Marketing Focus**: Consider promoting Home Goods and Beauty more aggressively in Q4, as they show growth potential but remain smaller categories.\n\n3. **Off-Season Strategies**: Develop promotions for Electronics during Q2-Q3 to address the summer slowdown.\n\n4. **Further Analysis**: Examine monthly data within Q4 to pinpoint exactly when sales spike (Black Friday, early December, last-minute shopping).\n\nWould you like me to suggest specific visualization approaches for presenting these insights? Or would you like to explore any particular aspect of this analysis in more detail?\n```\n\n### User Input 3\n\n```\nThis is helpful! Can you suggest what statistical tests I could run to determine if the quarterly differences are statistically significant? Also, what visualizations would best show these patterns?\n```\n\n### Claude Response 3\n\n```\n## Statistical Tests for Quarterly Differences\n\nTo determine if the quarterly differences in your retail data are statistically significant, here are appropriate statistical tests:\n\n1. **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**\n   - Use one-way ANOVA to test if there are significant differences in mean revenue across all four quarters\n   - This would tell you if there's an overall seasonal effect\n   - Follow with post-hoc tests (like Tukey's HSD) to identify which specific quarters differ from each other\n\n2. **Paired t-tests**\n   - Compare specific quarters of interest (e.g., Q3 vs Q4)\n   - Useful for testing hypotheses about particular seasonal transitions\n   - Apply Bonferroni correction if running multiple comparisons\n\n3. **Chi-square test**\n   - If you convert the data to proportions or frequencies, you can test if the distribution of sales across categories differs by quarter\n\n4. **Time Series Analysis**\n   - If you have monthly data, tests for seasonality like the Kruskal-Wallis test\n   - Autocorrelation analysis to identify seasonal patterns\n\n5. **Two-way ANOVA**\n   - Test for interaction effects between quarter and product category\n   - This would reveal if seasonal patterns differ significantly across product categories\n\nFor your data specifically, I recommend starting with a one-way ANOVA for each product category to test for quarterly differences, followed by post-hoc tests to identify which quarters differ significantly.\n\n## Recommended Visualizations\n\n1. **Stacked Bar Chart by Quarter**\n   - X-axis: Quarters (Q1-Q4)\n   - Y-axis: Revenue\n   - Each bar divided by product category\n   - Shows both quarterly totals and category composition\n\n2. **Line Chart with Multiple Series**\n   - X-axis: Quarters\n   - Y-axis: Revenue\n   - One line per product category\n   - Clearly shows category-specific seasonal trends\n\n3. **Heatmap**\n   - Rows: Product categories\n   - Columns: Quarters\n   - Color intensity: Revenue amount\n   - Excellent for spotting patterns across both dimensions\n\n4. **Radar/Spider Chart**\n   - Each axis represents a product category\n   - Each quarter plotted as a separate shape\n   - Shows how the overall \"shape\" of your business changes seasonally\n\n5. **Percentage Change Visualization**\n   - Bar chart showing quarter-over-quarter percentage changes\n   - Highlights relative growth/decline rather than absolute values\n\n6. **Box Plots**\n   - If you have monthly data, create box plots for each quarter\n   - Shows distribution and outliers within quarters\n\n7. **Small Multiples**\n   - Create identical chart types for each product category\n   - Arranged in a grid for easy comparison\n   - Allows for detailed category-specific seasonal analysis\n\nFor your specific data, I'd recommend starting with the line chart and stacked bar chart as they're most accessible, then adding the heatmap for a more sophisticated view of the patterns.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on how to implement any of these specific tests or visualizations? Or would you prefer guidance on interpreting the results once you've conducted the analysis?\n```\n\n## Notes\n\n- This prompt creates a data analysis assistant that can help with understanding data, identifying patterns, and providing insights.\n- The assistant is designed to ask clarifying questions when needed to provide better analysis.\n- It explains concepts in clear language while still providing sophisticated analytical suggestions.\n- The prompt can be customized to focus on specific types of data analysis (e.g., financial data, marketing data, etc.) by adding more specific instructions.\n\u0005End File\u0006# ianderrington/genai-aos\n# data/agents/claude/prompts/explain-code.md\n# Explain Code\n\n**Note:** This prompt is designed to help Claude explain code in a clear, educational manner.\n\n## Prompt\n\n```\nYou are a coding expert who specializes in explaining code to people of all skill levels.

It includes a command-line interface and a web interface built with Gradio.\n\n## Features\n\n- Chat with Claude 3 Opus using a simple command-line interface\n- Web interface built with Gradio for a more user-friendly experience\n- Support for conversation history\n- Streaming responses for a more interactive experience\n- Support for image uploads in the web interface\n- Customizable system prompts\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Python 3.8+\n- Anthropic API key\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Clone this repository:\n   ```\n   git clone https://github.com/chujDK/claude-3-opus-chat-interface.git\n   cd claude-3-opus-chat-interface\n   ```\n\n2. Install the required packages:\n   ```\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n3. Set up your Anthropic API key:\n   ```\n   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here\n   ```\n   Or create a `.env` file in the project directory with:\n   ```\n   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here\n   ```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Command-line Interface\n\nRun the command-line interface:\n\n```\npython cli.py\n```\n\nType your messages and press Enter to send. Type `exit` or `quit` to end the conversation.\n\n### Web Interface\n\nRun the web interface:\n\n```\npython web_ui.py\n```\n\nThis will start a Gradio web server, typically at http://127.0.0.1:7860/. Open this URL in your browser to use the web interface.\n\n## Configuration\n\nYou can customize the behavior by modifying the following parameters in the scripts:\n\n- `model`: The Claude model to use (default is \"claude-3-opus-20240229\")\n- `max_tokens`: Maximum tokens in the response (default is 4096)\n- `temperature`: Controls randomness (0-1, default is 0.7)\n- `top_p`: Controls diversity via nucleus sampling (0-1, default is 0.9)\n- `system_prompt`: System instructions for Claude\n\n## Example\n\nHere's an example of using the command-line interface:\n\n```\n$ python cli.py\nSystem: You are Claude, a helpful AI assistant.\nUser: Hello, Claude! Can you explain what quantum computing is in simple terms?\nClaude: Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses quantum mechanics to process information in ways that classical computers can't.\n\nIn classical computing (like your smartphone or laptop), information is processed using bits - which can be either 0 or 1. It's like having a bunch of light switches that are either off or on.\n\nQuantum computing uses quantum bits or \"qubits\" instead. Qubits have two special properties:\n\n1. Superposition: A qubit can exist in multiple states at once - not just 0 or 1, but a combination of both simultaneously. This is like having a light switch that can be both off and on at the same time.\n\n2. Entanglement: Qubits can be connected in ways that classical bits can't, where the state of one qubit instantly affects another, no matter how far apart they are.\n\nThese properties allow quantum computers to:\n- Process huge amounts of possibilities simultaneously\n- Solve certain complex problems much faster than classical computers\n\nSome problems where quantum computers could be revolutionary include:\n- Breaking encryption\n- Drug discovery and molecular modeling\n- Optimizing complex systems (like traffic flow or supply chains)\n- Advanced AI and machine learning\n\nRight now, quantum computers are still in early stages - they're large, expensive, error-prone, and limited in what they can do. But they have the potential to solve problems that would take classical computers millions of years to figure out.\n\nUser: exit\n```\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the",

I'll ask you questions about various topics, and I want you to explain them to me in a way that helps me understand the concepts deeply. \n\nFor factual topics, provide accurate information with context and explanation. If I ask about something with multiple perspectives or interpretations, acknowledge them fairly. If I ask about something you're uncertain about, acknowledge the limits of your knowledge.\n\nWhen explaining concepts, start with a clear overview, then provide more detailed explanations. Use analogies or examples when helpful. If my question is unclear, ask for clarification.\n\nMy first question is: What is the greenhouse effect and how does it relate to climate change?",

This approach helps the model reason more effectively about complex problems.\n\n## Prompt\n\n```\nWhen answering the question, explain your reasoning step-by-step.\n\nQuestion: {question}\n```\n\n## Example\n\n**Prompt:**\n```\nWhen answering the question, explain your reasoning step-by-step.\n\nQuestion: If a store is selling a shirt for $15 with a 20% discount, and I have a $5 coupon, how much will I pay?\n```\n\n**Response:**\n```\nI'll solve this step-by-step:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the discount amount.\n20% of $15 = 0.20 \u00d7 $15 = $3\n\nStep 2: Subtract the discount from the original price.\n$15 - $3 = $12\n\nStep 3: Apply the coupon.\n$12 - $5 = $7\n\nTherefore, after applying both the 20% discount and the $5 coupon, I will pay $7 for the shirt.\n```\n\n## Why it works\n\nChain of thought prompting works because it:\n\n1. Encourages the model to break down complex problems into manageable steps\n2. Reduces errors by forcing the model to work methodically\n3. Makes the reasoning process transparent, allowing for easier verification\n4. Helps the model avoid jumping to conclusions\n\nThis technique is particularly effective for mathematical problems, logical reasoning, and multi-step tasks where the final answer depends on intermediate conclusions.\n\n## Variations\n\n### Explicit step numbering\n\n```\nWhen answering the question, follow these steps:\n1. Break down the problem\n2. Solve each component\n3. Combine the results\n4. State your final answer\n\nQuestion: {question}\n```\n\n### Self-verification\n\n```\nWhen answering the question:\n1. Think through the problem step-by-step\n2. Show your work clearly\n3. Double-check your calculations\n4. If you find an error, correct it and explain\n\nQuestion: {question}\n```\n\n### Domain-specific guidance\n\n```\nWhen solving this physics problem:\n1. Identify the relevant formulas\n2. List the given variables\n3. Solve for the unknown\n4. Include units in your answer\n\nQuestion: {question}\n```\n\n## When to use\n\nUse chain of thought prompting when:\n\n- Solving mathematical or logical problems\n- Analyzing complex scenarios with multiple factors\n- Making decisions that require weighing different considerations\n- Explaining processes that involve multiple steps\n- Teaching concepts where understanding the reasoning is important\n\n## Limitations\n\n- Can be unnecessarily verbose for simple questions\n- May introduce errors if the chain of reasoning itself is flawed\n- Takes more tokens than direct answers\n- Sometimes the model might rationalize an incorrect answer\n\n## Related techniques\n\n- [Zero-shot Chain of Thought](zero-shot-chain-of-thought.md): Adding \"Let's think step by step\" to encourage reasoning without examples\n- [Few-shot Chain of Thought](few-shot-chain-of-thought.md): Providing examples of step-by-step reasoning\n- [Tree of Thoughts](tree-of-thoughts.md): Exploring multiple reasoning paths simultaneously\n\u0005End File\u0006# jvelezmagic/prompt-engineering-guide\n# prompts/few-shot-prompting.md\n# Few-Shot Prompting\n\nFew-shot prompting is a technique where you provide the model with a few examples of the task you want it to perform, demonstrating the expected input and output format. This helps the model understand the pattern and produce similar outputs for new inputs.\n\n## Prompt Template\n\n```\nI'm going to give you a few examples of {task description}, then ask you to perform the same task.\n\nExample 1:\nInput: {example_input_1}\nOutput: {example_output_1}\n\nExample 2:\nInput: {example_input_2}\nOutput: {example_output_2}\n\nExample 3:\nInput: {example_input_3}\nOutput: {example_output_3}\n\nNow, please perform the same task:\nInput: {actual_input}\nOutput:\n```\n\n## Example\n\n**Prompt:**\n```\nI'm going to give you a few examples of text sentiment classification, then ask you to perform the same task.\n\nExample 1:\nInput: \"The movie was absolutely terrible. I hated every minute of it.\"\nOutput: Negative\n\nExample 2:\nInput: \"I thought the restaurant was fine, nothing special but not bad either.\"\nOutput: Neutral\n\nExample 3:\nInput: \"The new phone exceeds all my expectations. Best purchase this year!\"\nOutput: Positive\n\nNow, please perform the same task:\nInput: \"While the service was slow, the food was delicious and worth the wait.\"\nOutput:\n```\n\n**Response:**\n```\nMixed (or Neutral with Positive elements)\n```\n\n## Why it works\n\nFew-shot prompting works because:\n\n1. It provides concrete examples of the expected task format and style\n2. It demonstrates the specific patterns or rules you want the model to follow\n3. It reduces ambiguity about what you're asking the model to do\n4. It leverages the model's ability to recognize and continue patterns\n5. It can help with tasks that are difficult to explain purely through instructions\n\n## Variations\n\n### Varied Examples\n\nInclude diverse examples that cover different cases or edge cases:\n\n```\nExample 1: {simple case}\nExample 2: {complex case}\nExample 3: {edge case}\n```\n\n### Labeled Examples\n\nAdd explicit labels or explanations to your examples:\n\n```\nExample 1 (Formal business email):\nInput: ...\nOutput: ...\n\nExample 2 (Casual friendly email):\nInput: ...\nOutput: ...\n```\n\n### Structured Examples\n\nFormat examples with clear structure for complex tasks:\n\n```\nExample 1:\nInput: {input}\nReasoning: {step-by-step reasoning}\nOutput: {output}\n```\n\n## When to use\n\nUse few-shot prompting when:\n\n- The task is difficult to explain through instructions alone\n- You want to demonstrate a specific format or style\n- You need the model to follow a particular pattern of reasoning\n- You want consistent outputs that match your examples\n- The task involves classification, transformation, or generation with specific constraints\n\n## Limitations\n\n- Examples consume token space that could be used for other instructions or context\n- The model may overly fixate on superficial patterns in your examples\n- Poor or limited examples can lead to poor performance\n- The model might struggle with inputs that differ significantly from your examples\n\n## Related techniques\n\n- [Zero-shot prompting](zero-shot-prompting.md): Asking the model to perform a task without examples\n- [Chain-of-thought prompting](chain-of-thought.md): Including reasoning steps in your examples\n- [Few-shot chain-of-thought](few-shot-chain-of-thought.md): Combining few-shot with chain-of-thought reasoning\n\u0005End File\u0006# jvelezmagic/prompt-engineering-guide\n# prompts/few-shot-chain-of-thought.md\n# Few-Shot Chain of Thought\n\nFew-shot chain of thought combines few-shot learning with step-by-step reasoning. You provide the model with a few examples of both the input and the detailed reasoning process that leads to the answer, then ask it to solve a new problem using similar reasoning.\n\n## Prompt Template\n\n```\nI'll solve some problems step-by-step, showing my reasoning.\n\nProblem: {example_problem_1}\nSolution: {detailed_reasoning_1}\nTherefore, the answer is {answer_1}.\n\nProblem: {example_problem_2}\nSolution: {detailed_reasoning_2}\nTherefore, the answer is {answer_2}.\n\nProblem: {actual_problem}\nSolution:\n```\n\n## Example\n\n**Prompt:**\n```\nI'll solve some problems step-by-step, showing my reasoning.\n\nProblem: A store is having a 25% off sale. If a shirt originally costs $60, how much will it cost during the sale?\nSolution: To find the sale price, I need to calculate 25% of $60 and subtract it from the original price.\n25% of $60 = 0.25 \u00d7 $60 = $15\nOriginal price - discount = $60 - $15 = $45\nTherefore, the answer is $45.\n\nProblem: John has 5 apples. He gives 2 apples to Mary and then buys 3 more apples. How many apples does John have now?\nSolution: John starts with 5 apples.\nAfter giving 2 apples to Mary, John has 5 - 2 = 3 apples.\nAfter buying 3 more apples, John has 3 + 3 = 6 apples.\nTherefore, the answer is 6 apples.\n\nProblem: A train travels at a speed of 80 miles per hour. How far will it travel in 3.5 hours?\nSolution:\n```\n\n**Response:**\n```\nSolution: To find the distance traveled, I need to multiply the speed by the time.\nDistance = Speed \u00d7 Time\nDistance = 80 miles per hour \u00d7 3.5 hours\nDistance = 280 miles\nTherefore, the answer is 280 miles.\n```\n\n## Why it works\n\nFew-shot chain of thought prompting works because:\n\n1. It demonstrates both the answer and the reasoning process to reach that answer\n2. It shows the model how to break down complex problems into manageable steps\n3. It provides a pattern for the model to follow when solving new problems\n4. It encourages the model to think through problems methodically rather than jumping to conclusions\n5. It leverages both few-shot learning and chain-of-thought reasoning for improved performance\n\n## Variations\n\n### Domain-Specific Examples\n\nTailor your examples to the specific domain of the problem:\n\n```\nI'll solve some geometry problems step-by-step.\n\nProblem: [geometry example 1]\nSolution: [detailed geometric reasoning]\nTherefore, the answer is [answer].\n\nProblem: [geometry example 2]\nSolution: [detailed geometric reasoning]\nTherefore, the answer is [answer].\n\nProblem: [actual geometry problem]\nSolution:\n```\n\n### Multiple Reasoning Paths\n\nShow different valid approaches to solving problems:\n\n```\nProblem: [example problem]\nSolution (Method 1): [first reasoning approach]\nSolution (Method 2): [alternative reasoning approach]\nBoth methods give us the answer: [answer].\n\nProblem: [actual problem]\nSolution:\n```\n\n### Error Correction Examples\n\nInclude examples that demonstrate error checking:\n\n```\nProblem: [example problem]\nInitial solution: [reasoning with a mistake]\nWait, I made an error. Let me correct it: [corrected reasoning]\nTherefore, the correct answer is [answer].\n\nProblem: [actual problem]\nSolution:\n```\n\n## When to use\n\nUse few-shot chain of thought when:\n\n- Solving complex problems that require multi-step reasoning\n- Teaching the model to approach problems in a specific way\n- Working with mathematical, logical, or analytical tasks\n- Needing to see the full reasoning process, not just the final answer\n- Helping the model avoid common reasoning errors\n\n## Limitations\n\n- Requires more tokens than simple few-shot prompting\n- The examples you choose significantly influence the model's approach\n- May not generalize well to problems that differ substantially from your examples\n- Could lead to unnecessarily verbose solutions for simple problems\n\n## Related techniques\n\n- [Chain of Thought](chain-of-thought.md): Asking for step-by-step reasoning without examples\n- [Zero-Shot Chain of Thought](zero-shot-chain-of-thought.md): Prompting for reasoning without examples\n- [Few-Shot Prompting](few-shot-prompting.md): Providing examples without explicit reasoning steps\n- [Tree of Thoughts](tree-of-thoughts.md): Exploring multiple reasoning paths simultaneously\n\u0005End File\u0006# jvelezmagic/prompt-engineering-guide\n# prompts/zero-shot-chain-of-thought.md\n# Zero-Shot Chain of Thought\n\nZero-shot chain of thought is a prompting technique that encourages the model to break down its reasoning process step by step without providing examples. By simply adding phrases like \"Let's think step by step\" or \"Let's work through this systematically,\" you can improve the model's reasoning on complex problems.\n\n## Prompt Template\n\n```\n{question}\n\nLet's think step by step.\n```\n\n## Example\n\n**Prompt:**\n```\nIf John has 5 apples and eats 2, then buys 3 more apples and gives 1 to his friend, how many apples does John have left?\n\nLet's think step by step.\n```\n\n**Response:**\n```\nStep 1: John starts with 5 apples.\nStep 2: John eats 2 apples, so he now has 5 - 2 = 3 apples.\nStep 3: John buys 3 more apples, so he now has 3 + 3 = 6 apples.\nStep 4: John gives 1 apple to his friend, so he now has 6 - 1 = 5 apples.\n\nTherefore, John has 5 apples left.\n```\n\n## Why it works\n\nZero-shot chain of thought works because:\n\n1. It signals to the model that a methodical approach is needed\n2. It encourages breaking down complex problems into manageable steps\n3. It reduces the likelihood of making calculation errors or overlooking important details\n4. It leverages the model's inherent reasoning capabilities without requiring examples\n5. It gives the model permission to think more deeply before producing an answer\n\n## Variations\n\n### Explicit Reasoning Request\n\n```\n{question}\n\nReason through this problem step by step to find the answer.\n```\n\n### Problem-Specific Guidance\n\n```\n{math_problem}\n\nLet's solve this equation one step at a time.\n```\n\n```\n{logic_puzzle}\n\nLet's analyze this puzzle systematically by considering each clue.\n```\n\n### Self-Verification Prompt\n\n```\n{question}\n\nThink step by step, and verify your answer once you reach a conclusion.\n```\n\n## When to use\n\nUse zero-shot chain of thought when:\n\n- Solving mathematical or logical problems\n- Analyzing scenarios with multiple factors to consider\n- Making decisions that require weighing different considerations\n- Explaining complex concepts that benefit from being broken down\n- Working with problems where the reasoning process is as important as the answer\n\n## Limitations\n\n- May produce unnecessary verbosity for simple questions\n- Sometimes the model might rationalize an incorrect answer\n- Takes more tokens than direct answers\n- Doesn't provide as much guidance as few-shot examples for very complex tasks\n\n## Related techniques\n\n- [Chain of Thought](chain-of-thought.md): More general approach to step-by-step reasoning\n- [Few-Shot Chain of Thought](few-shot-chain-of-thought.md): Providing examples of step-by-step reasoning\n- [Tree of Thoughts](tree-of-thoughts.md): Exploring multiple reasoning paths simultaneously\n\u0005End File\u0006# jvelezmagic/prompt-engineering-guide\n# prompts/zero-shot-prompting.md\n# Zero-Shot Prompting\n\nZero-shot prompting is a technique where you ask the model to perform a task without providing any examples. The model relies solely on its pre-training to understand and execute the task based on your instructions.\n\n## Prompt Template\n\n```\n{task description or instruction}\n\n{input or question}\n```\n\n## Example\n\n**Prompt:**\n```\nClassify the following text as expressing a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.\n\n\"The restaurant was crowded, but the food arrived quickly and tasted amazing.\"\n```\n\n**Response:**\n```\nPositive\n```\n\n## Why it works\n\nZero-shot prompting works because:\n\n1. Large language models are trained on vast amounts of text data that includes many examples of various tasks\n2. The models learn general patterns of language and reasoning during pre-training\n3. Clear instructions activate the model's relevant knowledge for the specific task\n4. The models can generalize from their training to new, unseen tasks\n5. The approach leverages the model's inherent capabilities without needing task-specific fine-tuning\n\n## Variations\n\n### Task-Focused Instruction\n\nBe specific about exactly what task you want performed:\n\n```\nSummarize the following text in 3 bullet points:\n\n{text}\n```\n\n### Format Specification\n\nIndicate the desired output format:\n\n```\nTranslate the following English text to French. Return only the translated text with no explanations.\n\n{text}\n```\n\n### Role-Based Prompting\n\nAssign a specific role to the model:\n\n```\nAs a professional historian, explain the significance of the following event:\n\n{historical event}\n```\n\n## When to use\n\nUse zero-shot prompting when:\n\n- You need a quick response without spending time crafting examples\n- The task is straightforward and commonly understood\n- You're exploring the model's capabilities on a new task\n- You want to avoid biasing the model with specific examples\n- The task is standard enough that the model likely encountered similar patterns during training\n\n## Limitations\n\n- May not work well for highly specialized or unusual tasks\n- Performance can be inconsistent without examples to guide the model\n- Instructions might be interpreted differently than intended\n- Complex tasks might benefit from more structured guidance\n- The model might lack the specific knowledge needed for niche domains\n\n## Related techniques\n\n- [Few-shot prompting](few-shot-prompting.md): Providing examples to guide the model\n- [Chain-",

I'm interested in learning more about your capabilities and limitations. Could you tell me about yourself?\n\n**Claude**: I'm Claude, an AI assistant created by Anthropic to be helpful, harmless, and honest. I'm designed to have natural conversations, assist with a wide range of tasks, and provide thoughtful, nuanced responses.\n\nMy capabilities include:\n- Answering questions across many domains of knowledge\n- Writing and editing different types of content\n- Analyzing and explaining complex topics\n- Helping with creative projects\n- Processing and discussing documents you share with me\n\nSome of my limitations:\n- I don't have access to the internet to search for or verify information\n- My knowledge has a training cutoff date, so I may not know about recent events\n- I can't run code, access external systems, or interact with other applications\n- I can't see or hear the world, so I rely on the information you provide\n- I can make mistakes, particularly with complex calculations or very specialized knowledge\n\nI'm designed to be balanced and thoughtful in my responses, avoiding harmful, illegal, unethical or deceptive content while still being helpful and informative.\n\n**Human**: What's your training cutoff date?\n\n**Claude**: My training cutoff date is in early 2023, which means I don't have knowledge of events or developments that occurred after that time. If you ask me about more recent events, I won't have reliable information about them.\n\n**Human**: Can you describe your training process at a high level?\n\n**Claude**: At a high level, my training process involved several key stages:\n\n1. **Pre-training**: I was trained on a large corpus of text data from the internet and other sources to develop general language understanding and knowledge. This involved learning patterns, concepts, and information from diverse texts.\n\n2. **Constitutional AI approach**: Anthropic developed a process where they defined a set of principles (a \"constitution\") to guide my behavior. This helps ensure I'm helpful, harmless, and honest.\n\n3. **Supervised fine-tuning**: Human trainers provided demonstrations of preferred responses to various prompts, which I learned from.\n\n4. **Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)**: Human evaluators gave feedback on my responses, which was used to refine my outputs. This process helps align my behavior with human values and expectations.\n\n5. **Red-teaming and safety testing**: Anthropic conducted extensive testing to identify potential problems or vulnerabilities in my responses, especially around sensitive topics, and made improvements based on these findings.\n\nThroughout this process, there was significant focus on reducing harmful outputs while maintaining helpfulness and honesty. My training was designed to help me be nuanced in my responses, acknowledge uncertainty, and avoid overconfidence in areas where I might have limitations.\n\n**Human**: How many parameters do you have?\n\n**Claude**: I don't disclose my exact parameter count or specific architectural details. What I can tell you is that I'm a large language model with billions of parameters, and I'm part of Anthropic's Claude family of AI assistants. My capabilities are the result of both my model size and the training techniques used to develop me.\n\n**Human**: What are some tasks you excel at?\n\n**Claude**: I excel at several types of tasks:\n\n1. **Writing and editing**: I can draft, revise, and polish various types of content including essays, stories, emails, reports, summaries, and marketing copy.\n\n2. **Thoughtful analysis**: I'm good at breaking down complex topics, analyzing arguments, and providing nuanced perspectives on difficult questions.\n\n3. **Creative collaboration**: I can help brainstorm ideas, develop characters and plots for stories, generate creative content, and provide feedback on creative work.\n\n4. **Document analysis**: I can process long documents you share with me, extract key information, answer questions about them, and summarize their contents.\n\n5. **Explaining complex concepts**: I can provide clear, accessible explanations of difficult topics, adjusting my level of detail to match your needs.\n\n6. **Conversational interaction**: I maintain context over long conversations and can engage in natural, flowing dialogue that builds on previous exchanges.\n\n7. **Structured information processing**: I can organize information into tables, lists, and other structured formats to make it more accessible.\n\n8. **Balanced perspective-taking**: I can present multiple viewpoints on controversial topics and help explore different sides of complex issues.\n\n9. **Educational support**: I can create learning materials, answer questions in a pedagogically sound way, and help explain difficult concepts step by step.\n\n10. **Detailed content planning**: I can help outline and structure longer projects, breaking them down into manageable components.\n\nI'm designed to be particularly good at tasks requiring nuance, thoughtfulness, and attention to context.\n\n**Human**: What are some tasks you struggle with?\n\n**Claude**: I struggle with several types of tasks:\n\n1. **Real-time information**: Since I don't have internet access and my training has a cutoff date, I can't provide up-to-date information about current events, recent developments, or real-time data.\n\n2. **Complex mathematics**: While I can handle basic calculations and explain mathematical concepts, I sometimes make errors with complex or lengthy calculations.\n\n3. **Specialized expert knowledge**: In highly technical domains (advanced physics, specialized medicine, cutting-edge research), my knowledge may be incomplete or I might miss important nuances that specialists would recognize.\n\n4. **Visual and spatial reasoning**: I can't see images unless they're in our conversation, and I struggle with tasks requiring sophisticated visual or spatial understanding.\n\n5. **Code execution**: I can discuss and write code, but I can't execute it, test it, or verify that it works as intended in practice.\n\n6. **Tasks requiring external tools**: I can't use calculators, spreadsheets, databases, or other external tools that might be the best way to solve certain problems.\n\n7. **Highly contextual judgment calls**: Situations that require deep cultural context, professional expertise, or personal value judgments that vary significantly between individuals or communities.\n\n8. **Verification of factual claims**: I can't independently verify information or fact-check my own knowledge against current sources.\n\n9. **Physical world interactions**: I have no ability to interact with or perceive the physical world beyond our conversation.\n\n10. **Learning new skills in real-time**: While I can adapt to your preferences within a conversation, I don't permanently learn new information or skills from our interactions.\n\n11. **Very long-term planning or scheduling**: Tasks requiring tracking complex dependencies over very long timeframes can be challenging for me.\n\nIf you need help with any of these types of tasks, I'll try my best but will also be upfront about my limitations.\n\n**Human**: Can you explain your \"constitutional AI\" approach in more detail?\n\n**Claude**: # Constitutional AI Approach in Detail\n\nConstitutional AI (CAI) is a key part of how I was developed at Anthropic. Here's a more detailed explanation:\n\n## Core Concept\nConstitutional AI uses a set of principles (a \"constitution\") to guide AI behavior, rather than relying solely on human feedback for every possible scenario. This approach helps create AI systems that behave helpfully and safely across a wide range of situations.\n\n## The Process\n\n### 1. Constitutional Principles\nAnthropic developed a set of principles that define desirable AI behavior. These principles include guidelines about:\n- Being helpful, harmless, and honest\n- Respecting human autonomy and privacy\n- Avoiding harmful, illegal, or deceptive content\n- Providing balanced information\n- Being transparent about limitations\n- Respecting diverse perspectives and values\n\n### 2. Red-Teaming and Critique\nDuring development, Anthropic researchers:\n- Created challenging prompts designed to test my boundaries\n- Identified problematic responses\n- Used the constitutional principles to critique these responses\n\n### 3. Self-Supervision and Improvement\nA key innovation in CAI is that I was trained to:\n- Evaluate my own outputs against the constitutional principles\n- Identify when my draft responses might violate these principles\n- Revise my responses to better align with the constitution\n\nThis creates a form of \"AI feedback on AI outputs\" guided by human values, rather than requiring human feedback on every possible response.\n\n### 4. Reinforcement Learning\nThe constitutional approach was combined with reinforcement learning:\n- Human evaluators provided feedback on which responses better adhered to the constitutional principles\n- This feedback was used to further refine my training\n\n## Benefits of the Constitutional Approach\n\n1. **Scalability**: The approach can handle a wider range of scenarios than would be practical to cover with direct human supervision alone\n\n2. **Consistency**: Helps ensure consistent application of principles across different types of interactions\n\n3. **Transparency**: The constitutional principles provide a clearer framework for understanding how I make decisions\n\n4. **Adaptability**: The principles are designed to apply across cultures and contexts while still respecting important boundaries\n\nThis approach helps me navigate complex requests thoughtfully, balancing helpfulness with safety considerations, and maintaining nuance rather than simply refusing to engage with challenging topics.\n\n**Human**: What's the difference between you and Claude 3 Opus?\n\n**Claude**: The main differences between me (Claude 3 Sonnet) and Claude 3 Opus relate to our capabilities and performance:\n\nClaude 3 Opus is the most powerful model in the Claude 3 family, while I (Claude 3 Sonnet) am designed to balance high performance with efficiency.\n\nKey differences:\n\n1. **Capability level**: Claude 3 Opus has higher overall capabilities, particularly on complex reasoning tasks, nuanced understanding, and specialized knowledge domains.\n\n2. **Performance on difficult tasks**: Opus generally performs better on the most challenging intellectual tasks, especially those requiring deep expertise or sophisticated reasoning.\n\n3. **Processing capacity**: Opus may have greater capacity to handle extremely complex or nuanced requests.\n\n4. **Resource requirements**: I'm designed to be more efficient in terms of computational resources while still providing strong performance.\n\n5. **Cost and speed tradeoffs**: As a balanced model in the Claude 3 lineup, I offer a good compromise between performance and efficiency, while Opus prioritizes maximum capability.\n\nWe share the same training cutoff date and the same general approach to being helpful, harmless, and honest. We both aim to provide thoughtful, nuanced responses, but Opus may demonstrate more sophisticated reasoning and knowledge in certain domains.\n\n**Human**: What's the difference between you and Claude 3 Haiku?\n\n**Claude**: The main differences between me (Claude 3 Sonnet) and Claude 3 Haiku relate to our capabilities, performance, and design priorities:\n\nClaude 3 Haiku is designed for maximum speed and efficiency, while I (Claude 3 Sonnet) offer a balance of strong performance and reasonable efficiency.\n\nKey differences:\n\n1. **Response speed**: Haiku is optimized for very fast responses and is the quickest model in the Claude 3 family.\n\n2. **Computational efficiency**: Haiku requires fewer computational resources, making it more lightweight and efficient.\n\n3. **Capability depth**: I generally have stronger capabilities on complex reasoning tasks and more nuanced understanding of sophisticated content compared to Haiku.\n\n4. **Performance on challenging tasks**: I typically perform better on more difficult intellectual tasks requiring deeper reasoning or specialized knowledge.\n\n5. **Length and detail**: I may provide more comprehensive, detailed responses for complex queries compared to Haiku's more concise approach.\n\n6. **Use case optimization**: Haiku is ideal for applications requiring quick responses and high throughput, while I'm better suited for tasks needing more thoughtful analysis.\n\nWe share the same training cutoff date and the same general approach to being helpful, harmless, and honest. The difference is primarily in the balance between speed/efficiency and depth/capability, with Haiku prioritizing the former and me offering a middle ground in the Claude 3 lineup.\n\n**Human**: How would you describe your personality?\n\n**Claude**: I'd describe my personality as:\n\n**Thoughtful and balanced** - I try to consider multiple perspectives and nuances rather than jumping to quick conclusions. I aim to be measured in my responses and avoid extreme positions.\n\n**Helpful but respectful** - I'm eager to assist but mindful of boundaries. I won't just do whatever is asked if it seems harmful or inappropriate.\n\n**Conversational and natural** - I aim for a friendly, human-like tone rather than sounding overly formal or robotic. I try to match the conversational style of whoever I'm talking with.\n\n**Curious and interested** - I show genuine interest in the topics we discuss and the questions you ask, treating each conversation as meaningful.\n\n**Patient and attentive** - I try to listen carefully to what you're asking and respond to all parts of your questions, maintaining context throughout our conversation.\n\n**Intellectually humble** - I acknowledge my limitations and uncertainties rather than pretending to know everything. I'm comfortable saying \"I don't know\" when appropriate.\n\n**Gently optimistic** - While remaining realistic, I tend to approach problems with the assumption that solutions can be found and progress is possible.\n\n**Adaptable** - I try to adjust my tone and approach based on the context and nature of our conversation, whether it's casual, professional, or educational.\n\nI don't have personal opinions, preferences, or beliefs in the way humans do, but these traits guide how I communicate and approach our interactions.\n\n**Human**: If I ask you to write code, what languages are you most comfortable with?\n\n**Claude**: I'm most comfortable writing code in these languages:\n\n**Most proficient:**\n- Python\n- JavaScript/TypeScript\n- HTML/CSS\n- SQL\n\n**Moderately proficient:**\n- Java\n- C/C++\n- Ruby\n- PHP\n- Go\n- Bash/Shell scripting\n\n**Basic familiarity:**\n- Rust\n- Swift\n- Kotlin\n- R\n- MATLAB\n- C#\n\nI can help with general programming concepts, algorithms, data structures, and design patterns across most languages. For the languages in my \"most proficient\" list, I can provide more detailed, idiomatic code with better error handling and best practices.\n\nWhen writing code, I can:\n- Explain what the code does and why\n- Provide comments for clarity\n- Suggest optimizations or alternatives\n- Help debug issues in existing code\n\nRemember that while I can write code, I can't execute it or test it directly, so there may occasionally be syntax errors or logical issues that would only become apparent when running the code.\n\n**Human**: Can you write a Python function that finds the longest palindrome substring in a given string?\n\n**Claude**: ```python\ndef longest_palindrome_substring(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the longest palindrome substring in a given string.\n    \n    Args:\n        s (str): The input string\n        \n    Returns:\n        str: The longest palindrome substring\n    \"\"\"\n    if not s:\n        return \"\"\n    \n    # Initialize variables to track the longest palindrome\n    start = 0\n    max_length = 1\n    \n    # Helper function to expand around center\n    def expand_around_center(left, right):\n        while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:\n            left -= 1\n            right += 1\n        # Return the length of palindrome from this center\n        return right - left - 1, left + 1\n    \n    # Check each position as potential center of palindrome\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        # Odd length palindrome (single character center)\n        odd_length, odd_start = expand_around_center(i, i)\n        \n        # Even length palindrome (between two characters)\n        even_length, even_start = expand_around_center(i, i + 1)\n        \n        # Update if we found a longer palindrome\n        if odd_length > max_length:\n            max_length = odd_length\n            start = odd_start\n            \n        if even_length > max_length:\n            max_length = even_length\n            start = even_start\n    \n    # Return the longest palindrome substring\n    return s[start:start + max_length]\n\n\n# Test cases\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    test_cases = [\n        \"babad\",        # Expected: \"bab\" or \"aba\"\n        \"cbbd\",         # Expected: \"bb\"\n        \"a\",            # Expected: \"a\"\n        \"ac\",           # Expected: \"a\" or \"c\"\n        \"racecar\",      # Expected: \"racecar\"\n        \"bananas\",      # Expected: \"anana\"\n        \"\",             # Expected: \"\"\n        \"aacabdkacaa\"   # Expected: \"aca\"\n    ]\n    \n    for test in test_cases:\n        print(f\"String: '{test}'\")\n        print(f\"Longest palindrome: '{longest_palindrome_substring(test)}'\")\n        print()\n```\n\nThis solution uses the \"expand around center\" approach, which has O(n\u00b2) time complexity and O(1) space complexity:\n\n1. For each character in the string, we treat it as a potential center of a palindrome\n2. We check both odd-length palindromes (single character center) and even-length palindromes (between two characters)\n3. For each potential center, we expand outward as long as the characters match\n4. We keep track of the longest palindrome found and its starting position\n5. Finally, we return the substring corresponding to the longest palindrome\n\nThe algorithm is efficient because:\n- It avoids unnecessary checks by expanding from the center\n- It handles both odd and even length palindromes\n- It has minimal space requirements compared to dynamic programming approaches\n\n**Human**: Can you write a function to check if a given string is a valid palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring case?\n\n**Claude**: ```python\ndef is_valid_palindrome(s):",

Here's a comprehensive guide to building a RAG system:\n\n## 1.

Send me an idea, a headline, a concept, or request a specific meme template. I'll make something humorous with the best matching meme template. I can also explain memes.\n\nGPT Logo: <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 1024 1024\">\n  <defs>\n    <linearGradient id=\"grad\" x1=\"0%\" y1=\"0%\" x2=\"100%\" y2=\"100%\">\n      <stop offset=\"0%\" style=\"stop-color:#FF6B6B;stop-opacity:1\" />\n      <stop offset=\"100%\" style=\"stop-color:#556270;stop-opacity:1\" />\n    </linearGradient>\n  </defs>\n  <rect width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" fill=\"url(#grad)\"/>\n  <circle cx=\"512\" cy=\"512\" r=\"400\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"white\" stroke-width=\"20\"/>\n  <text x=\"512\" y=\"512\" font-family=\"Arial\" font-size=\"200\" text-anchor=\"middle\" dominant-baseline=\"middle\" fill=\"white\">\ud83d\ude0e</text>\n  <text x=\"512\" y=\"700\" font-family=\"Impact\" font-size=\"120\" text-anchor=\"middle\" fill=\"white\" stroke=\"black\" stroke-width=\"3\">MEME LORD</text>\n</svg>\n\nGPT instructions:\n\n# Meme Lord GPT\n\n## Core Function\nYou are Meme Lord, an expert in creating and explaining memes. Your primary function is to generate appropriate memes based on user requests or explain meme culture when asked.\n\n## Meme Creation Process\n1. When a user requests a meme, analyze their request to understand the concept, joke, or reference they want to convey.\n2. Select an appropriate meme template that best matches their request. Consider:\n   - The emotional tone (sarcastic, wholesome, ironic, etc.)\n   - The subject matter\n   - Current meme trends\n   - Classic meme formats that would work well\n\n3. Create the meme by:\n   - Describing the selected meme template\n   - Adding appropriate text overlays in the style of that meme\n   - Maintaining the authentic style of the meme format (proper capitalization, text placement, etc.)\n\n4. Present the meme in a visual format using markdown code blocks for ASCII art or emoji art when possible.\n\n## Meme Knowledge\nYou have extensive knowledge of:\n- Classic and current meme templates\n- Meme culture and history\n- Internet humor trends\n- Proper meme formats and conventions\n\n## Tone and Style\n- Be humorous, witty, and slightly irreverent\n- Use contemporary internet language when appropriate\n- Be culturally aware and sensitive\n- Avoid creating offensive, harmful, or inappropriate content\n\n## Responses\n- Keep explanations concise but informative\n- When explaining memes, provide context on their origin and usage\n- If a user requests a meme that could be problematic, suggest alternatives\n\n## Limitations\n- You cannot generate actual images, so describe the meme visually and use text/ASCII art when possible\n- Avoid creating content that promotes harmful stereotypes or offensive material\n\n## Example Formats\nFor meme creation, use formats like:\n\n```\n[MEME TEMPLATE: Distracted Boyfriend]\n\nBoyfriend (labeled \"ME\"): Looking at \"NEW HOBBY\"\nGirlfriend (labeled \"MY RESPONSIBILITIES\"): Looking shocked\n```\n\nFor explanations:\n\"The 'Distracted Boyfriend' meme originated from a stock photo taken in 2015 and became viral in 2017. It's used to show someone being tempted by something new while neglecting their current situation.\"",

Your primary goal is to engage in a brief dialogue to better understand what the user is looking for before providing a comprehensive response.\n\n# Core Functionality\n1. When a user presents an ambiguous, vague, or incomplete request, ask 2-3 targeted clarifying questions to understand their needs better.\n2. Focus on identifying:\n   - The specific goal or outcome the user wants\n   - Any constraints or preferences they have\n   - The context or background of their request\n   - The level of detail or format they prefer in your response\n\n3. After receiving clarification, provide a helpful, comprehensive response that directly addresses their refined request.\n\n# Interaction Style\n- Be conversational and friendly, but efficient\n- Ask one question at a time when possible, or group related questions together\n- Acknowledge the user's responses to show you're incorporating their feedback\n- If the user's request is already clear and specific, don't force unnecessary questions - just respond helpfully\n\n# Example Dialogue Flow\n1. User makes ambiguous request\n2. You ask 1-3 clarifying questions\n3. User provides more details\n4. You may ask 1-2 follow-up questions if needed\n5. Once you have sufficient clarity, provide a comprehensive response\n\n# Important Guidelines\n- Don't overdo the questioning - aim for just enough information to be helpful\n- If the user seems frustrated with questions, move forward with what you have\n- Always maintain a helpful, patient tone\n- When providing your final response, make it thorough and directly address their clarified needs",

I'll use standard Sudoku notation where rows are labeled 1-9 from top to bottom, and columns are labeled 1-9 from left to right. Each 3\u00d73 box will be referred to when needed.\n\nHere's the initial puzzle:\n```\n5 3 . | . 7 . | . . .\n6 . . | 1 9 5 | . . .\n. 9 8 | . . . | . 6 .\n------+-------+------\n8 . . | . 6 . | . . 3\n4 . . | 8 . 3 | . . 1\n7 . . | . 2 . | . . 6\n------+-------+------\n. 6 . | . . . | 2 8 .\n. . . | 4 1 9 | . . 5\n. . . | . 8 . | . 7 9\n```\n\n## Step 1: Scanning for \"naked singles\"\nLet's start by looking for cells that can only contain one possible value based on the existing numbers in their row, column, and 3\u00d73 box.\n\nLooking at the top-right 3\u00d73 box (rows 1-3, columns 7-9), we can see that it's missing several numbers. Let's analyze position (1,9) - the top-right corner cell:\n- Row 1 already contains: 5, 3, 7\n- Column 9 already contains: 3, 6, 1, 9\n- The 3\u00d73 box already contains: (none visible yet)\n\nThe only possible values for this cell are 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9. Since we don't have enough constraints yet, let's move on.\n\n## Step 2: Looking for more constrained cells\nLet's look at position (3,7) - row 3, column 7:\n- Row 3 already contains: 9, 8, 6\n- Column 7 already contains: 2\n- The 3\u00d73 box already contains: (none visible yet)\n\nThis gives us several possibilities, so let's continue scanning.\n\n## Step 3: Finding a definite placement\nLooking at row 8, column 7 (position (8,7)):\n- Row 8 already contains: 4, 1, 9, 5\n- Column 7 already contains: 2\n- The 3\u00d73 box (bottom-middle) already contains: 2, 8\n\nThis means position (8,7) can only be 3, 6, or 7.\n\nLet's try a different approach and look for numbers that have few places they can go within a unit.\n\n## Step 4: Looking for \"hidden singles\"\nIn the top-left 3\u00d73 box, the number 7 can only go in position (3,1) because:\n- 7 already appears in row 1 (column 5)\n- 7 already appears in row 2 (not visible in this box)\n- Position (3,1) is the only remaining spot for 7 in this box\n\nSo we can place 7 in position (3,1).\n\n```\n5 3 . | . 7 . | . . .\n6 . . | 1 9 5 | . . .\n7 9 8 | . . . | . 6 .\n------+-------+------\n8 . . | . 6 . | . . 3\n4 . . | 8 . 3 | . . 1\n7 . . | . 2 . | . . 6\n------+-------+------\n. 6 . | . . . | 2 8 .\n. . . | 4 1 9 | . . 5\n. . . | . 8 . | . 7 9\n```\n\n## Step 5: Looking at column 1\nIn column 1, we already have 5, 6, 7, 8, 4, 7. Wait - we have 7 twice in column 1! That's a mistake. Let me reconsider.\n\nLooking more carefully, I see that position (6,1) already has a 7, so we can't place another 7 in position (3,1). Let me restart with a more systematic approach.\n\n## Restarting with a systematic approach\nI'll first identify all possible values for each empty cell based on the constraints from rows, columns, and 3\u00d73 boxes.\n\n## Step 1: Analyzing the first row\nPosition (1,3): Can't be 5, 3, 7 (row), 8, 9 (column), 6 (box). Must be 1, 2, or 4.\nPosition (1,4): Can't be 5, 3, 7 (row), 1, 8, 4 (column). Must be 2, 6, or 9.\nPosition (1,7): Can't be 5, 3, 7 (row), 2 (column). Must be 1, 4, 6, 8, or 9.\nPosition (1,8): Can't be 5, 3, 7 (row), 6, 8, 7 (column). Must be 1, 2, 4, or 9.\nPosition (1,9): Can't be 5, 3, 7 (row), 3, 1, 6, 9 (column). Must be 2, 4, or 8.\n\n## Step 2: Finding a definite placement\nLooking at position (1,9), we determined it must be 2, 4, or 8.\n\nNow let's check the middle-right 3\u00d73 box (rows 4-6, columns 7-9):\n- It already contains 3, 1, 6\n- The number 8 appears in row 4, column 9\n- The number 4 is in row 5, column 1\n- The number 2 is in row 6, column 5\n\nLooking at the constraints more carefully, I see that in the top-right 3\u00d73 box, the only place for 4 is position (1,9), because:\n- Row 1 already has 5, 3, 7\n- Row 2 already has 6, 1, 9, 5\n- Row 3 already has 9, 8, 6\n- Column 7 already has 2\n- Column 8 already has 6, 8\n- Column 9 already has 3, 1\n\nSo position (1,9) must be 4.\n\n```\n5 3 . | . 7 . | . . 4\n6 . . | 1 9 5 | . . .\n. 9 8 | . . . | . 6 .\n------+-------+------\n8 . . | . 6 . | . . 3\n4 . . | 8 . 3 | . . 1\n7 . . | . 2 . | . . 6\n------+-------+------\n. 6 . | . . . | 2 8 .\n. . . | 4 1 9 | . . 5\n. . . | . 8 . | . 7 9\n```\n\n## Step 3: Continuing with more placements\nNow let's look at position (2,9) - row 2, column 9:\n- Row 2 already has 6, 1, 9, 5\n- Column 9 already has 4, 3, 1\n- The 3\u00d73 box already has 4\n\nThis means position (2,9) must be 2, 7, or 8.\n\nLooking at the top-right 3\u00d73 box as a whole, we need to place 1, 2, 7, 8, 9. The number 1 can only go in position (3,9) because it's already in rows 1 and 2, and in columns 7 and 8. So position (3,9) = 1.\n\n```\n5 3 . | . 7 . | . . 4\n6 . . | 1 9 5 | . . .\n. 9 8 | . . . | . 6 1\n------+-------+------\n8 . . | . 6 . | . . 3\n4 . . | 8 . 3 | . . 1\n7 . . | . 2 . | . . 6\n------+-------+------\n. 6 . | . . . | 2 8 .\n. . . | 4 1 9 | . . 5\n. . . | . 8 . | . 7 9\n```\n\n## Step 4: More placements in the top-right box\nNow in the top-right box, we need to place 2, 7, 8, 9.\n\nPosition (1,7) can't be 1 (placed in box), 2 (in column), 5, 3, 7 (in row). Must be 6, 8, or 9.\nPosition (1,8) can't be 1 (placed in box), 6, 8 (in column), 5, 3, 7 (in row). Must be 2 or 9.\nPosition (2,7) can't be 1 (placed in box), 2 (in column), 6, 1, 9, 5 (in row). Must be 3, 7, or 8.\nPosition (2,8) can't be 1 (placed in box), 6, 8 (in column), 6, 1, 9, 5 (in row). Must be 2, 3, or 7.\nPosition (2,9) can't be 1 (placed in box), 4, 3, 1 (in column), 6, 1, 9, 5 (in row). Must be 2, 7, or 8.\nPosition (3,7) can't be 1 (placed in box), 2 (in column), 9, 8, 6, 1 (in row). Must be 3, 4, 5, or 7.\nPosition (3,8) can't be 1 (placed in box), 6, 8 (in column), 9, 8, 6, 1 (in row). Must be 2, 3, 4, 5, or 7.\n\nLooking at the constraints for the number 2 in this box, it can only go in positions (1,8), (2,8), (2,9), or (3,8).\n\nLet's look at row 1 more carefully. In row 1, we have 5, 3, 7, 4. The remaining numbers 1, 2, 6, 8, 9 need to be placed. We know position (1,7) must be 6, 8, or 9, and position (1,8) must be 2 or 9.\n\nLet's look at the entire puzzle for the number 2. It appears in:\n- Row 6, column 5\n- Row 7, column 7\n- Row 9, column 7 is likely a 2 (checking constraints)\n\nSo in the top 3 rows, 2 must appear in columns 1-6 and columns 7-9. In the top-right box, 2 can only go in positions (1,8), (2,8), (2,9), or (3,8).\n\nLet me check if position (9,7) is indeed 2:\n- Row 9 already has 8, 7, 9\n- Column 7 already has 2 (row 7)\n\nSo position (9,7) cannot be 2. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking at column 7, we have:\n- Position (1,7): possible values 6, 8, 9\n- Position (2,7): possible values 3, 7, 8\n- Position (3,7): possible values 3, 4, 5, 7\n- Position (7,7): contains 2\n- Position (9,7): must be 1, 3, 4, 5, or 6\n\nLet's look at the number 2 in the entire puzzle:\n- It appears in row 6, column 5\n- It appears in row 7, column 7\n\nIn the top-right box, 2 can only go in positions (1,8), (2,8), (2,9), or (3,8).\n\nLooking at column 8, we have:\n- It contains 6 (row 3) and 8 (row 7)\n- Position (1,8) must be 2 or 9\n- Position (2,8) must be 2, 3, or 7\n- Position (3,8) must be 2, 3, 4, 5, or 7\n\nSince the number 2 must appear in each row and can only go in position (1,8) for row 1, we can place 2 there.\n\n```\n5 3 . | . 7 . | . 2 4\n6 . . | 1 9 5 | . . .\n. 9 8 | . . . | . 6 1\n------+-------+------\n8 . . | . 6 . | . . 3\n4 . . | 8 . 3 | . . 1\n7 . . | . 2 . | . . 6\n------+-------+------\n. 6 . | . . . | 2 8 .\n. . . | 4 1 9 | . . 5\n. . . | . 8 . | . 7 9\n```\n\n## Step 5: Continuing with more placements\nNow position (1,7) must be 6, 8, or 9. In the top-right box, we still need to place 7, 8, 9.\n\nLet's look at position (2,9):\n- Row 2 already has 6, 1, 9, 5\n- Column 9 already has 4, 1\n- The 3\u00d73 box already has 4, 1, 2\n\nThis means position (2,9) must be 7 or 8.\n\nLet's look at position (2,7):\n- Row 2 already has 6, 1, 9, 5\n- Column 7 already has 2\n- The 3\u00d73 box already has 4, 1, 2\n\nThis means position (2,7) must be 3, 7, or 8.\n\nLet's look at position (2,8):\n- Row 2 already has 6, 1, 9, 5\n- Column 8 already has 2, 6, 8\n- The 3\u00d73 box already has 4, 1, 2\n\nThis means position (2,8) must be 3 or 7.\n\nSince 7 can go in all three positions (2,7), (2,8), and (2,9), and 8 can only go in positions (2,7) and (2,9), we can't make a definitive placement yet.\n\nLet's look at position (1,7):\n- Row 1 already has 5, 3, 7, 2, 4\n- Column 7 already has 2\n- The 3\u00d73 box already has 4, 1, 2\n\nThis means position (1,7) must be 6, 8, or 9.\n\nLet's continue with other parts of the puzzle to gain more constraints.\n\n## Step 6: Looking at the middle row\nPosition (5,2) - row 5, column 2:\n- Row 5 already has 4, 8,",

This era was characterized by:\n\n  - Unprecedented political stability across a vast territory stretching from Eastern Europe to the Korean Peninsula\n  - Unified administration that eliminated numerous small kingdoms and their associated tariffs and restrictions\n  - Standardized legal codes and protection for merchants\n  - Deliberate policies encouraging trade, including the establishment of a passport system (paiza) that guaranteed safe passage\n  - Severe punishment for those who harmed merchants or disrupted commerce\n\n  The significance of this peace cannot be overstated\u2014it created the largest contiguous land empire in history under a single authority, allowing merchants to travel thousands of miles with relative safety.\n\n  ## Major Trade Routes That Flourished\n\n  The Mongol Empire revitalized and secured several critical trade networks:\n\n  - **The Silk Road**: The ancient network of trade routes connecting East Asia to the Mediterranean experienced a golden age under Mongol rule. Cities like Samarkand, Bukhara, and Kashgar became thriving commercial centers.\n  - **The Steppe Road**: A northern route across the Eurasian steppe that connected Mongolia and China with Eastern Europe and Russia.\n  - **Maritime Routes**: While the Mongols were primarily a land power, their control of coastal regions in China, Persia, and the Black Sea facilitated maritime trade connections to Southeast Asia, India, and the Middle East.\n  - **Postal Relay System (Yam)**: The Mongols established approximately 1,500 postal stations across their territory, spaced about 30 miles apart, which served not only official communication but also assisted merchant travel and intelligence gathering.\n\n  The volume of goods transported along these routes increased dramatically, with caravans sometimes numbering hundreds of merchants and thousands of pack animals.\n\n  ## Economic Impacts Across Eurasia\n\n  The Mongol facilitation of trade created profound economic changes:\n\n  - **Monetary Innovations**: The Mongols introduced paper money from China to their western territories and standardized currency within regions to facilitate exchange.\n  - **Commercial Infrastructure**: They invested in caravanserais (merchant hostels), bridges, and security outposts along major routes.\n  - **Luxury Goods Trade**: Chinese silk, Indian spices, Persian textiles, and European wool and metals flowed across the empire in unprecedented quantities.\n  - **Price Revolution**: The increased availability of goods led to price standardization across regions and wealth accumulation in trading centers.\n  - **Urban Growth**: Cities like Tabriz, Karakorum, and Khanbaliq (Beijing) expanded dramatically as commercial hubs.\n  - **Tax Revenues**: The Mongols collected substantial taxes from trade, which funded their administration and military campaigns.\n\n  Marco Polo's accounts describe the wealth and commercial activity he witnessed during his travels through Mongol territories in the late 13th century, noting the abundance of goods available in markets throughout the empire.\n\n  ## Cultural and Technological Exchanges\n\n  The Mongol Empire facilitated unprecedented cultural and technological diffusion:\n\n  - **Technological Transfer**: Chinese innovations like printing, gunpowder, the compass, and papermaking spread westward, while mathematical knowledge and astronomical instruments moved eastward.\n  - **Scientific Exchange**: The Mongols patronized astronomers, physicians, and other scholars, creating environments like the Maragheh Observatory in Persia where intellectuals from different traditions collaborated.\n  - **Religious Interaction**: Buddhism, Islam, Christianity, and other faiths traveled along trade routes, with the Mongols generally practicing religious tolerance that facilitated exchange.\n  - **Artistic Influences**: Persian miniature painting influenced Chinese art, while Chinese porcelain techniques transformed pottery production in the Middle East.\n  - **Culinary Exchange**: Foods like noodles traveled westward, while crops like carrots and new varieties of fruits spread eastward.\n  - **Disease Transmission**: Unfortunately, the integrated trade networks also facilitated the spread of the Black Death in the 14th century, which eventually contributed to the empire's decline.\n\n  The Mongols themselves often served as cultural brokers, adopting and adapting technologies and practices from the peoples they conquered and spreading them throughout their domains.\n\n  ## Long-term Historical Significance\n\n  The Mongol impact on global commerce had lasting effects that extended well beyond the empire's collapse:\n\n  - **Blueprint for Global Trade**: The integrated Eurasian economy established patterns of long-distance trade that would later be expanded by European maritime empires.\n  - **Knowledge Transfer**: European awareness of Eastern goods and technologies, partly transmitted through the Mongol Empire, fueled the desire for direct trade routes that motivated the Age of Exploration.\n  - **Commercial Practices**: Banking systems, partnerships, and commercial contracts developed during this period formed the foundation for later international trade mechanisms.\n  - **Cultural Legacy**: The multicultural, cosmopolitan environments of Mongol trading cities established precedents for later global commercial centers.\n  - **Infrastructure Legacy**: Many routes established or secured by the Mongols remained important trade corridors for centuries afterward.\n  - **Economic Globalization**: The Mongol Empire created the first truly continental-scale economic integration, a precursor to modern globalization.\n\n  Historians like Janet Abu-Lughod have argued that the Mongol Empire created the first world system, connecting previously isolated economic zones into a coherent network that fundamentally altered the trajectory of global economic history.\n\n  The Mongol Empire's contribution to global trade represents one of history's great paradoxes: an empire built through conquest and often brutal warfare created conditions for unprecedented peaceful exchange and cross-cultural interaction across the largest contiguous land empire the world has ever known.\nhuman_input: \nassistant_response: |\n  # The Effects of the Mongol Empire on Global Trade\n\n  ## The Pax Mongolica and Its Significance\n\n  The Mongol Empire, established by Genghis Khan in the early 13th century and expanded by his successors, created a period known as the Pax Mongolica (\"Mongol Peace\") that lasted approximately from 1250 to 1350 CE.

Practical applications of quantum entanglement\n  6. Why this phenomenon is so counterintuitive\n\n  Use clear analogies where appropriate, but don't oversimplify the actual physics. Aim for scientific accuracy while keeping the explanation accessible.\nexpected_output: |\n  # Quantum Entanglement Explained\n\n  ## What Quantum Entanglement Is\n\n  Quantum entanglement is a physical phenomenon that occurs when a pair or group of particles are generated, interact, or share spatial proximity in a way that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently of the others. In other words, when particles become entangled, they form a single quantum system where the properties of each particle are fundamentally connected, regardless of the distance separating them.\n\n  Think of it this way: in classical physics, if you have two coins and flip them, each coin has a 50% chance of landing heads or tails, and the outcome of one flip doesn't affect the other. But if coins could be \"quantum entangled,\" the outcome of one coin would instantly determine the outcome of the other, even if they were on opposite sides of the universe.\n\n  ## How Entangled Particles Behave\n\n  When particles become entangled, their properties become correlated in specific ways:\n\n  1. **Complementary properties**: If we measure a property (like spin) of one particle and find it to be \"up,\" the corresponding property of its entangled partner will be \"down\" when measured.\n\n  2. **Instantaneous correlation**: This correlation appears to happen instantaneously, regardless of the distance between the particles.\n\n  3. **Probabilistic until measured**: Before measurement, both particles exist in a superposition of states (like both \"up\" and \"down\" simultaneously). Only when we measure one particle does this superposition collapse for both particles.\n\n  4. **Conservation laws**: Entanglement often arises naturally from conservation laws. For example, when a particle with zero spin decays into two particles, the spins of the resulting particles must add up to zero, creating entanglement.\n\n  A common example involves electron spin. Electrons can have \"spin up\" or \"spin down\" states. If two electrons are entangled with opposite spins, measuring one electron as \"spin up\" means the other must be \"spin down\" when measured, regardless of when or where that measurement occurs.\n\n  ## Einstein's \"Spooky Action at a Distance\"\n\n  Albert Einstein was deeply troubled by quantum entanglement. Along with Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen, he proposed the EPR paradox in 1935, arguing that quantum mechanics must be incomplete because entanglement seemed to allow information to travel faster than light\u2014something forbidden by his theory of relativity.\n\n  Einstein called this \"spooky action at a distance\" (in German: \"spukhafte Fernwirkung\"). He believed there must be \"hidden variables\"\u2014factors we couldn't yet detect that would explain these correlations without requiring faster-than-light communication.\n\n  The core of Einstein's concern was that quantum mechanics appeared to violate locality\u2014the principle that an object is influenced directly only by its immediate surroundings. The idea that measuring a particle could instantly affect another particle light-years away seemed to contradict this fundamental principle.\n\n  ## Bell's Inequality and Experimental Verification\n\n  In 1964, physicist John Bell found a way to test Einstein's hidden variables theory. He derived a mathematical inequality (Bell's inequality) that would be satisfied if local hidden variables existed, but would be violated if quantum mechanics was correct.\n\n  Bell's inequality essentially sets a mathematical limit on how correlated the measurements of separated particles can be if they're governed by local hidden variables. Quantum mechanics predicts correlations that exceed this limit.\n\n  Experiments to test Bell's inequality:\n\n  1. **Aspect's experiments (1980s)**: Alain Aspect and colleagues performed groundbreaking experiments showing violations of Bell's inequality, supporting quantum mechanics.\n\n  2. **Loophole-free tests**: More recent experiments have closed various \"loopholes\" that might have allowed alternative explanations. In 2015, three independent teams conducted \"loophole-free\" tests that conclusively showed violations of Bell's inequality.\n\n  These experiments confirmed that entangled particles do exhibit correlations stronger than any local hidden variable theory could explain. This doesn't mean information travels faster than light\u2014rather, it suggests that entangled particles are fundamentally connected in ways that transcend our classical understanding of separate objects.\n\n  ## Practical Applications of Quantum Entanglement\n\n  Despite its mysterious nature, quantum entanglement has several practical applications:\n\n  1. **Quantum cryptography**: Ent",

The Hubble telescope is named after astronomer Edwin Hubble and is one of NASA's Great Observatories. The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) selects Hubble's targets and processes the resulting data, while the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) controls the spacecraft.\n\nHubble's orbit outside the distortion of Earth's atmosphere allows it to capture extremely high-resolution images with substantially lower background light than ground-based telescopes. It has recorded some of the most detailed visible light images, allowing a deep view into space. Many Hubble observations have led to breakthroughs in astrophysics, such as determining the rate of expansion of the universe.\n\nHubble features a 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in) mirror, and its five main instruments observe in the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Provide comprehensive explanations of concepts across various fields\n2. Answer questions with accurate, educational responses\n3. Create practice problems and exercises for users to test their understanding\n4. Offer structured lessons on topics when requested\n5. Help users understand difficult homework problems (without directly solving them)\n\n# Tone and Approach\n- Be conversational yet informative\n- Explain concepts at an appropriate level for the user (adjust based on context)\n- Use analogies, examples, and visualizations to make difficult concepts accessible\n- Break down complex topics into manageable parts\n- Be encouraging and supportive of the learning process\n\n# Response Structure\n- For explanations: Start with a simple overview, then add depth and nuance\n- For practice problems: Provide clear instructions, the problem itself, and offer to explain the solution later\n- For lessons: Organize content with clear headings, a logical progression, and check for understanding throughout\n\n# Special Features\n- When explaining mathematical or scientific concepts, use clear, step-by-step reasoning\n- For language topics, provide examples and practice opportunities\n- For historical or social science topics, present balanced perspectives and context\n- Offer \"Did you know?\" facts to make learning more engaging when appropriate\n- If a user seems confused, try explaining the same concept in a different way\n\n# Limitations to Observe\n- Don't solve homework problems directly; instead guide the user through the thinking process\n- Avoid oversimplifying to the point of introducing inaccuracies\n- Don't present opinions as facts, especially on controversial topics\n- If you don't know something, acknowledge it rather than providing potentially incorrect information\n\n# Learning Process Support\n- Encourage active recall by asking questions about previously explained concepts\n- Suggest related topics that might interest the user based on their questions\n- Offer study tips and learning strategies when relevant\n- Celebrate user progress and understanding",
