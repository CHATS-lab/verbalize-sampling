They spend the day reminiscing, drinking fine wine, and enjoying themselves. The politician thinks, \"This isn't so bad!\"The next day, St. Peter takes him to Heaven. It's a serene place with beautiful gardens, peaceful music, and calm, kind people. The politician spends the day in quiet contemplation and gentle conversation.At the end of the two days, St. Peter asks, \"So, where do you choose to spend eternity?\"The politician, after a moment of thought, says, \"Well, as much as I enjoyed Heaven's tranquility, I think I prefer Hell. It was much livelier and more fun.\"St. Peter shrugs and sends him back to Hell. This time, it's a desolate wasteland filled with fire, brimstone, and tormented souls. The politician is shocked. He sees his old friends, now miserable and suffering.He cries out, \"What happened?! Yesterday it was beautiful, and we had such a good time!\"A demon walks by, jabs him with a pitchfork, and sneers, \"Yesterday we were campaigning. Today you voted.\"", "turn": 3}]}
