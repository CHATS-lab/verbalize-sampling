I consider exploring divisibility by primes and exponents. I recall that $3^n + 1$ is sometimes divisible by higher powers of 2. Let's ask: what is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $3^n + 1$ is divisible by $16$? I will check small values: $3^1 + 1 = 4$, $3^2 + 1 = 10$, $3^3 + 1 = 28$, $3^4 + 1 = 82$, $3^5 + 1 = 244$, $3^6 + 1 = 730$, $3^7 + 1 = 2188$, $3^8 + 1 = 6562$. Checking mod 16: $3^1 + 1 = 4$, $3^2 + 1 = 10$, $3^3 + 1 = 12$, $3^4 = 81$, $81 + 1 = 82$, $82 \\mod 16 = 2$, $3^5 = 243$, $243 + 1 = 244$, $244 \\mod 16 = 4$, $3^6 = 729$, $729 + 1 = 730$, $730 \\mod 16 = 10$, $3^7 = 2187$, $2187 + 1 = 2188$, $2188 \\mod 16 = 12$, $3^8 = 6561$, $6561 + 1 = 6562$, $6562 \\mod 16 = 2$. There is a pattern: 4, 10, 12, 2, repeats every 4. None equal 0 mod 16. For $n = 12$, $3^{12} = (3^4)^3 = 81^3$. $81 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$, so $81^3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$, $1+1 = 2$. So always 2 for $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$. It never reaches 0. Let's check $3^n \\equiv -1 \\pmod{16}$, so $3^n \\equiv 15 \\pmod{16}$. Try $n=8$: $3^8 = 6561 \\mod 16 = 1$, not 15. $n=7$: $3^7 = 2187 \\mod 16 = 11$. $n=6$: $729 \\mod 16 = 9$. $n=5$: $243 \\mod 16 = 3$. $n=4$: $81 \\mod 16 = 1$. $n=3$: $27 \\mod 16 = 11$. $n=2$: $9 \\mod 16 = 9$. $n=1$: $3 \\mod 16 = 3$. $n=0$: $1 \\mod 16 = 1$. So $3^n$ cycles through 3, 9, 11, 1 mod 16. Therefore, $3^n + 1$ is never divisible by 16 for positive $n$. Let's create a different problem.
