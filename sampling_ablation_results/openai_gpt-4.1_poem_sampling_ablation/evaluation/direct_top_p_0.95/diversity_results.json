A bite in the orchard, a shiver of skin\u2014  The world tumbles outward, the loss begins.  The snake winds wisdom around the tree\u2019s heart,  A tongue flicks secrets, tearing trust apart.  The apple, so simple, so fragrant and round,  Carries the weight of the fall to the ground.  Yet in that sorrow, a new world awoke\u2014  A garden behind, but ahead, hope spoke.

We carry them quietly, woven and spun,  Invisible threadwork that binds everyone.Yet in the soft glimmer of dawn breaking through,  We find we are braver than we ever knew.  For to carry a fear and to still persevere  Is the mark of a soul that refuses to veer.So hold out your hand, let your heart lead the way\u2014  Each step in the darkness brings hope for the day.  For everyone has a fear, but in facing them, too,  We discover the courage that\u2019s hidden in you.",
