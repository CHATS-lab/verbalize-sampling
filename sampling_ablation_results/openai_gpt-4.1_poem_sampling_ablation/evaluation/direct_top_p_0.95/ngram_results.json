Truth, you are quiet in the cluttered parade  Of opinions and headlines and promises made.  You wait in the spaces between what I say,  A whisper of honesty, kept at bay.

Yet I know you are patient, you do not demand\u2014  You rest in the hush of a gentle, cupped hand.  So, Truth, let me practice the art of your sound,  To listen and carry your weight all around.

You demand only presence: my silent, unguarded attention.  Let me grow familiar with your contours,  Recognize your timbre in the cacophony of pretense.  For if I am to give you shape in the world,  I must first make a home for you within\u2014  A habit of listening,  A promise to speak.",

I court you in the quiet, where my restless fears subside,  And only when I welcome you, you linger by my side.  You\u2019re woven in the small things: the honest glance, the gentle word,  The wisdom held in pauses, in the stories seldom heard.  How many times I\u2019ve hurried, turning from your gentle call\u2014  Yet you return with patience, shining through the pall.  No silver tongue can summon you, nor clever mind alone;  But by the art of listening, your voice becomes my own.  So teach me, Truth, to seek you not as prize or sword or shield,  But as a constant presence, in surrender I must yield.  Then, when I speak, let what I say be shaped by what I knew:  I shall be in habit of listening, and in speaking, speak you true.",

To speak you, Truth, I must first make space inside,  Sweep out the cluttered chambers where my small fears hide,  Sit with the ache of honesty, let it settle in my bones,  And honor your reflection in the voices not my own.  So I pledge to listen deeply\u2014beyond comfort, beyond pride\u2014  To hush my rushing judgments, let your river decide.

Cicadas sang hymns from the heart of the heat,  While shadows retreated from shimmering wheat.  A hush lay on willows, on rivers that gleamed,  Each leaf was a lantern where sunlight had streamed.  The air wore a perfume of clover and hay,  And time seemed to drowse in the arms of the day.  Clouds drifted slowly, pale ships in the blue,  Their sails catching stories the breezes once knew.  Children laughed lightly, their voices like pearls,  Tossed high in the stillness, a sweet summer swirl.  \u2019Twas noontide of summer, and everything paused\u2014  In that golden abundance, the world was becalmed.  Promise hung thick as the honeybee\u2019s flight,  And dreams floated gently in rivers of light.",

No trumpet blared, no banners high,  Just burning truth that could not lie;  He spoke and hearts were torn in two\u2014  Old lies unmasked, the world anew.  Not gentle balm for ancient scars,  But fire to kindle fallen stars,  A word that cleaved the dark in twain,  And promised life through death and pain.  The sword he bore was not of steel,  But sharp enough to make us feel  The cost of love, the price of grace,  The courage called to seek His face.  So in the stillness, hear His call\u2014  He comes not just to comfort all,  But to divide, to break, to heal:  The sword of truth, the wound that\u2019s real.",

Acres of silence, a sky stretched so wide,  The ghost of a garden, a gate open wide,  A stoic old gum tree, its branches outspread,  Shelters the dreams of the people long fled.  Here, dusk writes in gold on the hills rolling low,  And stars gather close when the night starts to grow.  Kangaroos pause by a fencepost to hear  The hush of the land at the edge of the year.  In the faintest of breezes, a melody weaves  Through grasses grown wild and the rustle of leaves.  Though distant from voices, from laughter and town,  The heart of the West wears a weathered old crown.  So sing for the silence, and sing for the dust\u2014  For hope that endures, for faith, and for trust.  On a lonely selection, far out and unseen,  Dwells the soul of the West, steadfast and serene.",

No more the dust, no more the dread,  No more the shivering of bone;  I shed the husks my fear had fed  And claimed the sinew as my own.Now upright in the morning\u2019s gold,  I cast aside my former skin;  No longer grovelling, small, or cold\u2014  I stand where growing can begin.
