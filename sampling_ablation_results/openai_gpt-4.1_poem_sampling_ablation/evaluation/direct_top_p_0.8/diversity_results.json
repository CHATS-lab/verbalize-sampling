For though this anger burns so deep,  It teaches me the will to keep\u2014  To rise, to heal, to try again,  To find the calm beyond the flame.",

The shadows grow long as the dusk settles low,  And the cry of a curlew drifts soft and slow;  A kettle is singing a lonesome refrain  To the whisper of grasses that thirst for the rain.  No neighbor to visit, no voices but these\u2014  Just the song of the breeze in the silver-leaf trees.

It curls in the chest, a flutter, a drum,  It sharpens the senses, it makes the heart numb.  Yet fear is a teacher, a secret, a guide\u2014  It shows us our limits, the places we hide.  It asks us to listen, to breathe and to trust,  To step through the darkness, to do what we must.  For courage is born where our trembling begins,  In the face of our worry, our losses, our sins.  So honor the fear, let it whisper and steer\u2014  For everyone carries a shadow, my dear.  And sometimes, in sharing the things we conceal,  We find in each other the strength to heal.  Everyone has a fear\u2014this much is true\u2014  But together, there\u2019s nothing we cannot walk through.",

And facing that shadow, we learn to be brave\u2014  To reach for the light, to rise from the cave.So hold your fear gently, acknowledge its place,  It\u2019s part of your story, your struggle, your grace.  Everyone has a fear\u2014let it be known\u2014  But we walk on together, and never alone.",
