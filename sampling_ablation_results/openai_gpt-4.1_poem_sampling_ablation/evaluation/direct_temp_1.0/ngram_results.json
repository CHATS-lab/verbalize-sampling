How often I run from your quiet conviction,  Build walls out of noise, let reason wear thin\u2014  Yet you linger behind every flicker of fiction,  A lantern within me that burns from within.  If I am to utter your syllables honestly,  I must learn to dwell in your difficult grace,  To cradle your silence, to hear what is costly  In the hush between heartbeats, the depth in your face.  So teach me to listen, to still every longing  That tugs me away from your luminous track;  Let habit be built on the labor of longing  Until what I speak is the truth I bring back.  O Truth, in your echo I\u2019ll train ear and tongue\u2014  Only by hearing you will my speaking be sprung.",

You pulse beneath my ribcage, asking to be sought,  Patient as the dawn, steady as the flight of light.  To speak you, Truth, I must first unclench my fist,  Set aside the armor of comfort, the veil of denial;  I must dwell in your presence, risk all I\u2019ve missed,  Let you echo within, mile upon trembling mile.

We trade in wit, in memes and gifs,  Pretending pain is far away,  As if a jest can mend the rifts  Or make the shadows turn to day.  But somewhere, soldiers fold their fears  Into a letter, stained with sand;  A mother soothes a child through tears,  And peace is bargained, hand to hand.  So here, where war\u2019s a fleeting quip\u2014  A punchline in our daily scroll\u2014  Let\u2019s taste our words before we sip,  And feel the weight we might control.

I loved the moon\u2019s uncertain gleam,  The hush of thought, the tangled dream;  Found solace in the restless breeze  And solace too among the trees.  A watcher at the window-pane,  I traced the ghost of every pain,  For from that first remembered day  I walked a wilder, winding way.

It flickers in the trembling hands  Of those who walk alone at dawn,  It circles with invisible bands  Around the dreams we dwell upon.  Some fear the hush before the storm,  The spaces where no voices dwell,  Some dread the breaking of the norm,  A sudden, strange and distant bell.  Others fear the words unsaid,  Or time\u2019s relentless, tireless flow\u2014  The faces fading in their stead,  The days they wish they\u2019d never know.  Yet fear is but a gentle thread  That binds us closer, heart to heart,  Reminding us, as paths we tread,  Of strength and courage we impart.  For though a fear may softly start  As trembling, as a shadowed tear,  Within each ever-beating heart  Is hope that rises from the fear.",

A fear of the darkness where answers dissolve,  A fear of the questions we\u2019ll never resolve.  We carry these shadows wherever we go,  A secret companion that nobody knows.  But see how the morning can soften the shade,  How hope finds a crack in the walls we have made.  Though fear walks beside us, its grip may release  When courage and kindness unravel its fleece.  Everyone has a fear\u2014this, too, is true:  Yet everyone, too, has the strength to get through.  So honor the shadow, but look for the sun\u2014  For fear, though it lingers, is never all one.",

It might be letting go, or reaching for the sky,  The pain of saying farewell, or never asking why.We hide them in our laughter, disguise them as a grin,  Build walls of busy moments to keep the terror in.

So I lifted my gaze to the treetops,  Let hope paint a map on my skin;  The claws of the past loosened slowly,  And sunlight poured gently within.Now I walk upright with the morning,  A witness to what I became:  Once bound to the dark and the lowly,  Now risen, yet humbled the same.
