It\u2019s easy, safe, to jest and sneer  At boots that trample foreign dust,  While headlines fade and reappear,  And medals tarnish, left to rust.  We trade in wit, in memes and gifs,  Pretending pain is far away,  As if a jest can mend the rifts  Or make the shadows turn to day.  But somewhere, soldiers fold their fears  Into a letter, stained with sand;  A mother soothes a child through tears,  And peace is bargained, hand to hand.  So here, where war\u2019s a fleeting quip\u2014  A punchline in our daily scroll\u2014  Let\u2019s taste our words before we sip,  And feel the weight we might control.  For war\u2019s a joke, until it\u2019s not\u2014  When laughter chokes and eyes are wet;  Remember those who pay the cost,  And hold their memory with regret.",

No postman comes calling, no footsteps draw near,  Just the wind\u2019s muffled whisper and wild kangaroo deer;  A rusted gate swings with a sorrowful moan,  Each morning brings gold but the evening brings stone.  In the hush of the twilight, as shadows descend,  The memories gather, old sorrows unbend;  Yet hope lingers stubborn, like roots in dry sand,  And dreams sow their seeds in the salt-bitten land.  The stars hang like lanterns, cold fire overhead,  Lighting stories forgotten, of words left unsaid;  Though distance may sever the world from the rest,  A heart keeps on beating far out in the West.",

      "response": "Everyone has a fear, tucked deep within the bone,  A shadow in the morning light, a whisper when alone.  Some keep it hidden under smiles, bright and neat,  Others walk beside it, shuffling anxious feet.  It lingers at the edges of a well-rehearsed laugh,  Threads through the silence when company is half,  It\u2019s the tremor in a handshake, the catch in a sigh,  The reason for the stories we quietly deny.  Some fear the ending, others the start,  Some dread the breaking, or the opening heart,  A word left unspoken, a door left unclosed,  The memory of winters that once left us exposed.  But fears, for their shadows, also teach us to see\u2014  To value the sunlight, to know what could be,  To gather our courage, like dawn gathers day,  And step through the darkness, come what may.  Everyone has a fear, and yet\u2014here we stand,  Reaching for each other with trembling hand,  Finding, in sharing the things we conceal,  That fears can be softened, and wounds can heal.",
