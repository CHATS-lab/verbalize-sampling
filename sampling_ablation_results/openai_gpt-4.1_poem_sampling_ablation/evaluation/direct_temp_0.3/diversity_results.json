I learned to love the shadowed room,  The silver hush of falling rain,  The way the dusk would softly bloom  And cradle all that felt like pain.  Yet in the quiet, something grew\u2014  A secret garden, wild and deep,  Where dreams like moths in darkness flew  And memories curled themselves to sleep.  So let me walk the twilight\u2019s seam,  Unfurling truths the day can\u2019t see;  For I have lived within a dream  That shaped the heart inside of me.  From childhood\u2019s hour I have not been  A stranger to the night\u2019s embrace\u2014  It taught me how to look within  And find the light in shadow\u2019s place.",

He strode through dust and trembling crowd,  His eyes alight, His voice unbowed;  He shattered chains, He spoke aloud  Of kingdoms lost and hearts unplowed.  No gentle breeze, but thunder\u2019s call,  He turned the tables in the hall,  Dividing night from morning\u2019s pall,  Demanding sacrifice from all.  He did not come to soothe or mend  The easy lies we\u2019d call a friend;  But to divide, to break, to bend\u2014  To challenge love, and hate, and end.  Yet in the clash, a hope was born:  A world remade, a soul reborn;  For peace is forged where truth is sworn\u2014  On the edge of Christ\u2019s sharp sword.",

Some fear the darkness, the unknown, the end,  Others the silence that follows goodbye,  Some fear the truth, or the dreams they defend,  Or the tears that they\u2019re too proud to cry.  But fear is a thread in the fabric we weave,  A lesson, a warning, a reason to grow\u2014  It shapes who we are and what we believe,  A shadow that teaches the light how to glow.  So hold to your fear, let it whisper its name,  For courage is born in the arms of the night.  Everyone has a fear, and yet all the same,  We rise, and we walk, and we reach for the light.",

People are happy in the dance of small things\u2014  A child\u2019s sudden giggle, a dog\u2019s eager leap,  The promise that every new morning brings,  The comfort of dreams that visit our sleep.  People are happy, and sometimes it\u2019s fleeting,  A song in the heart that can vanish with rain,  But even in sorrow, in parting, in meeting,  The memory of joy will quietly remain.  So let us be happy, if only for now,  Let us gather the light as it falls on our days,  For people are happy, and we\u2019ll learn somehow  To hold onto that feeling in infinite ways.",
