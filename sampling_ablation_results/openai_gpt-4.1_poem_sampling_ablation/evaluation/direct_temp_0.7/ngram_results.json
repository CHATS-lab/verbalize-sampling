If I welcome your whisper when silence is near,  And sit with the quiet that trembles with fear.  For truth is a river that runs through the soul,  Not summoned by shouting, nor bent to control.  She knocks on the doors of the mind, ever slight,  Waiting for stillness to bring her to light.  So I practice the patience of ears finely tuned,  To the softest confessions the night has perfumed.  I cradle your presence like morning dew,  And learn, in the waiting, what\u2019s lasting and true.  For words may be many, but wisdom is few,  And truth only answers to those who pursue.  So, Truth! I shall speak you, but only because  I listened in wonder, and learned who I was.  In echoes and pauses, your lessons begin\u2014  To listen is always the place to begin.  And only in habit of hearing you through,  Can I ever be worthy of speaking you too.",

A swallow swooped low, then soared out of sight,  As if chasing dreams through the corridors of light.  \u2019Twas noontide of summer\u2014a breath held in time,  When earth wears her glory, resplendent, sublime.  And all living things, for a moment, confess  The wonder of sunlight, the hush of its bless.",

Still, jokes are armor, thin and worn;  They shield our hearts, but never last.  We mock the wars we never mourn,  And pray the punchlines never pass.  So let us laugh, if laugh we must,  But know behind each jested view:  War\u2019s a joke for me and you\u2014  Until the joke comes calling, too.",

His sandals stirred the dust of doubt, his eyes both flame and flood,  He cleaved the silence with his voice, split stone and bone and blood.  He came not bearing olive branch, nor soft, consoling hymn,  But thundered down the temple steps, with righteous wrath and vim.  He shattered old complacencies, unmasked the veiled and vain,  He turned the tables of the world, and shattered every chain.  His sword was not of tempered steel, nor forged in earthly fire,  But sharp enough to pierce the heart, and set the soul entire.  He waged a war on shadowed lies, on comfort\u2019s gilded throne,  And called the meek to rise and speak, to claim the world their own.  So follow not the quiet road, nor fear the clash and storm\u2014  For sometimes peace is born in strife, and truth in breaking form.  On the scene came Christ The Lord, with sword and flame and word,  And in the blaze, the world remade, its sleeping spirit stirred.",

Not to lull the world to sleep,  But rouse the hearts that dreamers keep,  He drew a line within the sand,  And summoned courage, took a stand.

He did not bring the easy truce,  Nor gentle balm for old misuse;  But shattered chains and shattered lies,  And opened hearts with fierce surprise.  So comes the sword, so comes the light,  To wake the dead, to blind the sight.  O Christ the Lord, the world adored\u2014  Peace divides when Truth is poured.",

A kettle\u2019s soft whistle, a flicker of light,  Are comforts that cradle the silence of night.  The ghosts of old drovers ride under the stars,  Their stories remembered in weathered guitar.  On this lonely selection, far out and alone,  The heartbeat of country is steady as stone.  So raise up a mug to the land and the sky,  To the courage of those who were willing to try,  For hope lives and lingers, a welcome old guest,  On a lonely selection far out in the West.",

Some fear the thunder\u2019s roar or the silence of the night,  Others dread the leaving, or the absence of light.  It\u2019s woven in the stories we tell to one another,  In the trembling confessions we hide from our mother.  It slips through our laughter, a thread in the seams,  Haunting the edges of our daylight dreams.  A fear of falling, of failing, of being alone,  Of voices unheard or a heart turned to stone.  It\u2019s the hush before answers, the pause in a plea,  The what ifs that echo in the deepest of seas.  Yet, in this shared trembling, a solace appears\u2014  The knowledge that everyone carries their fears.  We gather them gently, like stones by the shore,  Finding courage together to bear a little more.  So let your fear tremble, don\u2019t hide it away;  It\u2019s the common ground on which hope finds its way.  For everyone has a fear, it\u2019s true and it\u2019s clear\u2014  But together, we\u2019re braver than any one fear.",
