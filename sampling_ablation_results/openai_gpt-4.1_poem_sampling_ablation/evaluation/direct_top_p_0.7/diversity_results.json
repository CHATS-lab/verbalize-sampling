Truth, be my companion in the daily litany,  So that when I am called to speak,  I will not search for you as a stranger,  But offer you as a friend who has walked with me,  Step by step, word by word, all my days.",

Not comfort, but a challenge hurled\u2014  A fire to cleanse, to change the world.  He did not come to soothe or please,  But to ignite the hearts and knees.A sword to sever night from day,  To carve a wild and holy way;  And in his words, a storm began\u2014  The clash of heaven\u2019s hope with man.  So let us stand, though hearts are floored,  For on the scene came Christ The Lord.",

A magpie\u2019s brief chorus, a curlew\u2019s lament\u2014  All sing of the distance, of years softly spent.  The homestead is weathered, its timbers grown grey,  Yet laughter once lingered at dusk\u2019s gentle sway.  Now only the crackle of embers remains,  And footprints are softened by time and by rains.  Yet beauty endures where the wild heart is free,  In the sweep of the plain, in the salt of the sea,  In the solitude vast, in the starlit caress,  On a lonely selection far out in the West.  So here in the hush, where horizons unfold,  A spirit persists, both stoic and bold\u2014  Rooted in red earth, in struggle and rest,  On a lonely selection far out in the West.",

The bold fear the breaking of all they have built,  The kind fear the sharpness of anger and guilt.  Yet fear is a lantern, a guide through the night,  It sharpens our senses, it teaches us flight.  And sometimes, in facing the thing we most dread,  We find out we\u2019re braver than we ever have said.  So hold out your fear, let it shimmer and gleam\u2014  It\u2019s part of your story, the thread in your seam.  Everyone has a fear, but remember, my friend,  It\u2019s not where we start, but where courage will end.",
