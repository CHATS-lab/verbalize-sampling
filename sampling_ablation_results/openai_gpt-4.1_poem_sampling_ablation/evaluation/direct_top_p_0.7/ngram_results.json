Truth, you do not shout, nor dress in grand attire;  You wait in the gentle hush after questions,  Or in the ache of a heart that dares to listen.  I must unlearn my rehearsed replies,  And let your candor shape my voice anew.  For only the listener, humble and attentive,  Can become the speaker you trust to bear your light.  So teach me the discipline of listening\u2014  To the whisper of conscience, the murmur of doubt,  The stories behind another\u2019s eyes\u2014  That when I open my mouth,  You, truth, may walk out unafraid,  Wearing the simple grace of a voice  That has learned, first, to hear.",

Cicadas were singing their shimmering tune,  While shadows grew drowsy in gardens of June,  The river moved slowly, a ribbon of glass,  Reflecting the blue of the sky as I passed.  No breeze dared to wander, no cloud dared to roam,  The day wore its stillness like silk on a throne,  And time, for a moment, forgot how to run\u2014  Suspended in wonder, in light, and in sun.  I lingered in clover, the scent on my skin,  The laughter of children rang faintly within,  And all of the world seemed to pause and agree:  At noontide of summer, it\u2019s good just to be.",

But in Your presence, I confess\u2014  Though night may fall and doubt appears,  Your love endures, my heart to bless.  So let me rise, though fears abound,  And walk the path that You have shown;  For in Your light, my soul is found\u2014  And I am never quite alone.",

His gaze is a window, cracked and deep,  Where shadows curl and secrets creep,  A thousand stories tangled in his stare,  Unspoken, burning, heavy as air.  He smiles, and it shivers along my skin,  A warning, a question, a dare to begin  Some dance at the edge of reason\u2019s shore,  Where the world is less and madness more.  Yet in that chaos, something calls\u2014  A flicker of truth through crumbling walls,  A plea for mercy, or kin, or light,  Lost in the labyrinth of his night.  So I hold his gaze, and I do not run,  For all of us falter, all come undone;  In the wild, the broken, the haunted cries\u2014  We meet ourselves in a madman\u2019s eyes.",

Not to lull the world to sleep,  But to waken what we keep  Buried deep in shadowed rooms\u2014  He called the dead to leave their tombs.  His sword was not of steel or blood,  But fire, spirit, holy flood;  A line drawn sharp in shifting sand,  A call to rise, to take a stand.  The sword he bore was word and will,  To pierce the night, the doubt, the chill;  To separate the true from lies,  And open long-unseeing eyes.  So now the world is split apart\u2014  Not by hate, but by the heart\u2014  On the scene came Christ The Lord,  Not with peace but with a sword.",

No gentle breeze, but storm and flood,  He drew a line, He spilled His blood,  And in that clash of earth and sky  He taught us how to live\u2014and die.  For peace is forged through honest strife,  And love is not a quiet life;  He came with sword to rend apart  The veils that smothered every heart.

He writes to the city\u2014his words sparse and few,  Of the stars blazing wide, and the vastness of blue.  Yet his heart beats in rhythm with magpies and dust,  On a lonely selection, in patience and trust.  For here in the silence, he\u2019s stitched to the land,  A soul quietly shaped by the sweep of its hand.  Though distance and longing may circle his chest,  He calls it his home, far out in the West.",

A weathered old homestead, its timbers grown gray,  Stands watch over paddocks where memories stray;  The sun bleeds its crimson on rusted barbed wire,  And dusk kindles hope in a smoldering fire.  No neighbors to greet you, no voices but crows,  Just the hush of the earth and the tales that it knows\u2014  Of seasons that wither, of rains that forget,  Of dreams that are woven in hardship and sweat.  Yet under the vastness, where starlight is spun,  A solace is found when the long day is done.  For out in the silence, your heart learns to roam,  And the sky, wide and endless, will teach you of home.",

People are happy in the chorus of the city,  Buses humming, voices weaving through the air,  A thousand stories, ordinary, pretty,  Finding comfort just in knowing someone\u2019s there.  People are happy in the hush of quiet places,  A hand held gently, eyes meeting in the park,  Warmth exchanged in silent, sacred spaces,  Hope flickering like lanterns in the dark.  People are happy, not in grand or gilded halls,  But in moments small, unpolished, barely seen\u2014  A shared umbrella when the sudden rain falls,  A glance, a word, a space to dream between.  People are happy, though the world may often tire,  Because happiness is kindled, not acquired\u2014  A candle burning, passed from heart to heart,  A promise that we\u2019re never far apart.",

People are happy in quiet hours,  Tea steaming, petals on flowers,  Books unfolding, time unwinding,  Small delights, the heart reminding.  People are happy, not always loud,  Sometimes hidden in a crowd,  A glance, a touch, a whispered word,  A song remembered, faintly heard.
