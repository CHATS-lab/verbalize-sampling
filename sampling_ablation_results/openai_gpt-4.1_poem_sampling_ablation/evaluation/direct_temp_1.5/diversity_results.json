Doves took flight beneath His hand\u2014  Yet His words cut through the land;  Ancient bonds and kindred ties,  Laid before unflinching eyes.  No gentle lamb, but thunder roared,  On the scene came Christ the Lord\u2014  Love that burns and won\u2019t concede,  Blood and justice, faith and deed.  So when we hear His summons call,  Do we rise, or do we fall?  For peace He gave a higher claim\u2014  The fire and the sacred flame.",

There are fears that appear as shadows at dusk,  Quiet, insistent, impossible to brush  From the back of the mind or the tip of the tongue,  Or the moment before a song is sung.  Fears of the ending, or of beginning;  Fears in the silence, or with voices spinning.  The hush before storm, the ring of the phone,  Or facing a room while feeling alone.  But look, in the eyes of a friend, there\u2019s a gleam\u2014  A reflection that shows you are not unseen.  Everyone stumbles, uncertain, unclear,  Holding on tightly to hopes and to fears.  So gather your courage, breathe deep, step through\u2014  The bravest of hearts still tremble like you.  For fear is a lantern we all must bear\u2014  It flickers and guides us from here to there.",
