Let me cradle your silence in my open palms,  Testing the weight of honesty, unpolished, unplanned.  Let me kneel in the garden of doubt,  Pulling up weeds of pride and fear,  To find your fragile seedlings,  And tend them with the humility of not knowing.  For only one who listens\u2014truly listens\u2014  Can speak you, Truth, with a voice clear as morning,  With a tongue shaped by candor, not comfort,  With eyes unclouded by longing for applause.  Teach me, then, to be your faithful student,  So that when I speak, it is your song I sing\u2014  Low, quiet, persistent\u2014  The music of one who has learned to hear.",

Dear love, for nothing less than thee  Would I walk these winding miles,  Or gather dreams from distant seas  And shape them into smiles.  The world may offer kingdoms grand  Or promise stars to own,  Yet all I wish is just your hand,  Your voice, your soul alone.  For what is wealth but empty sound  If you are not beside?  A thousand suns that spin around  Still leave my heart untied.  So let the world its fortunes keep,  Its fleeting ecstasy\u2014  Dear love, for nothing less than thee  Could ever ransom me.",

I watched the others at their play,  Their laughter bright, their footsteps sure,  While shadows gathered where I lay,  A stranger to the simple, pure.  Yet in those dusky, silent rooms  Where moonlight gathered on the wall,  I found a language in the glooms,  A secret voice that dared to call.  It whispered stories, old and deep,  Of hidden hopes and haunted skies,  Of dreams that wander while we sleep,  And longing that never truly dies.  From childhood\u2019s hour I have not been  A mirror of the world\u2019s delight\u2014  But from that place, apart, unseen,  I learned to love the gentle night.

A kettle is singing a note soft and clear,  As memories gather when evening draws near.The gumtrees stand sentry, their shadows run deep,  While the silence grows wide where the grass-kangaroos leap.  A figure moves slowly through dust and through dreams,  Hands roughened by labor, heart stitched at the seams.In the hush of the night, under infinite sky,  Loneliness lingers but hope doesn\u2019t die.  For out in the West, where the distance is grand,  A spirit endures, shaping life from the land.So here on this selection, with sorrow and song,  The story continues, resilient and strong.  Though lonely the outpost, and endless the quest,  There\u2019s beauty and courage far out in the West.",

It tiptoes in the hush of midnight,  carves cold rivers down the spine,  paints what-ifs on the canvas of dreaming,  braids thorns through hope\u2019s tender vine.  Some fear the tumble of tomorrow,  others, the echo of the past\u2014  Some, the silence between heartbeats,  or that joy is too fragile to last.  Yet within each trembling moment,  in each shudder and unshed tear,  something gentle grows in the dark\u2014  the courage to cradle our fear.  For fear is the price of loving,  the twin of every leap and start,  the shadow that sharpens the sunlight,  the hush that reveals the heart.  So let us name our trembling,  and walk on despite the cost,  for in the honest holding of fear  we find what was never lost.",

It whispers in corners, it waits at the door,  A ghost in the hallway, a crack in the floor.Some cradle a silence, afraid it will break,  Some shiver at thunder that memory makes.  A heart can grow quiet from all that it hides,  A trembling child where the wild thing resides.Yet fear is a lantern, unsteady and bright,  It flickers and falters but sharpens our sight.  We gather our courage, stitch hope to our seams,  And walk through the darkness that holds all our dreams.We speak to our worries and teach them our names,  We dance with the unknown, we kindle the flames.  For everyone has a fear, old friend and foe near\u2014  Yet in facing the shadows, our hearts become clear.",

No longer grovelling in the sand,  I lift my gaze, the sky comes near.  For every creature learns to grow,  From desperate dark to golden glow.",
