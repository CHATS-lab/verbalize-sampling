He called the meek to rise and speak,  He stirred the strong to aid the weak;  His message, fierce as summer storm,  Did not conform, but did transform.  For peace that\u2019s built on broken lies  He shattered, bidding souls arise\u2014  To choose the light, to stand apart,  And bear the wound within the heart.  His sword was love, unbound, untamed,  A fire that cleansed, a voice that named  The cost of grace, the price of truth\u2014  Not comfort, but the ache of growth.  So on the scene, with sword in hand,  The Lord declared: now take your stand\u2014  For peace will come, but not by fear,  The sword divides so hope draws near.",

No gentle word to soothe the night, but fire for the bone,  He split the darkness with His voice and claimed the world His own.  Mother against daughter stood, and son opposed to sire,  As hearts were kindled, cold and dead, set suddenly on fire.  He came not just to heal and hold, but to divide the soul\u2014  To call the spirit from its sleep and make the broken whole.  The sword He bore was not of steel but sharper than a cry,  It cut away the lies and veils, exposed the reason why.  So trembling still we meet His gaze, and hear the echo strong\u2014  Not peace, but life\u2019s dividing line, that shows us right from wrong.
