From childhood\u2019s hour the distance grew\u2014  A thread that wove me far apart,  Yet through the mist, one constant true:  The haunted, fragile pulse of heart.  Still now I wander, seeking skies  That arch in strange and private hue,  For all I am, behind these eyes,  Is something old, and wild, and true."}]}

Not as bringer of the dawn,  But fire through the careful lawn\u2014  Love ablaze to sweep the chaff  Where comfortable lies are drawn.The gentle hands that heal and bless  Now gripped resolve, denied caress;  To startle, stir, disturb the dust  Of hearts grown cold and motionless.

The apple, with its promise of secrets to be known,  Gleamed in eager fingers, the roots of doubt now sown.How swiftly innocence is lost to hunger for the truth,  And exile is the price for the restless heart of youth.  But oh, what lives we lead\u2014haunted by that fall,  Still dreaming of a garden, and wishing not to crawl.For every tongue that trembles, for every heart that yearns,  We tell and retell stories so humanity returns  To reckon with the shadows and reconcile the cost,  To learn from ancient wisdom what paradise has lost.The snake and the apple\u2014a tale retold in time,  Of longing and of choices, of sorrow and of rhyme.  Still, from fallen gardens, our dreams and questions swell;  The snake and the apple is a sorry tale to tell."}]}

An old homestead stands where the magpies convene,  Walls built of dreams and tin, dusted silver and green.The laughter and labor, the quiet and strife,  Woven through silence that stitches this life.  Acres of memory stretch under sky\u2014  A place for the heart to ask \"how\" and \"why.\"When night finds the paddocks and shadows draw near,  The loneliness deepens but so does the clear  Wide wonder that settles like dew on the earth\u2014  A feeling of longing, and sometimes of worth.So far from the bustle, the river, the rest,  Still hope carves a garden far out in the West,  Where morning keeps rising on ridges of stone,  And even in silence, you\u2019re never alone."}]}

A step in the dark, or a knock at the door\u2014  Small seeds of worry, we each harbor more.Under our laughter, behind every smile,  Is something that chills us, if just for a while.  We armor ourselves, pretend not to see,  But fear, in its wisdom, is never set free.Yet within that shiver, the hush of our dread,  Lies courage untested and words left unsaid.  For fear, when confronted, transforms and reveals  The boldest of hearts and the truest ideals.So honor your fear\u2014let it teach, not control.  It\u2019s proof that you\u2019re human, imperfect and whole.  In the garden of shadows, hope still appears\u2014  For light finds its meaning in all of our fears."}]}
