I walk through days with clenched fists tight,  My words are embers, sharp and bright,  Yet no one sees the flames I hide,  The molten rivers locked inside.  But anger, too, is forged from pain\u2014  A longing for the gentle rain,  A hope that, through the fire\u2019s release,  I\u2019ll find at last a kind of peace.  So let it burn, but not consume,  Let fury light a brighter room,  Transform the blaze to guiding sun\u2014  This anger, deep, can be undone."}]}

It flickers in the quiet hours,  a shadow cast by broken powers,  roots entwined in memory\u2019s towers,  fed by wounds the world devours.  I wear a mask of calm and grace,  but fire dances in its place;  it shapes my words, it marks my pace,  a hidden sun I can\u2019t erase.  Yet in this heat, I find my voice\u2014  a sharpened edge, a stubborn choice\u2014  to rise, to speak, to claim, rejoice,  and turn the flame to something poised.  This anger, deep, does not destroy;  it carves a path, it builds, employs  the force to heal, to change, deploy\u2014  from burning pain, I forge my joy."}]}

The world, unwrapped in gentle gold,  Spilled secrets on the window sill,  And I, unburdened, simply held  The quiet promise, soft and still.For the first time in my life  I let the silence fill my chest,  No racing thoughts, no need for more,  Just breath, and heart, and open door.  The sky, unhurried, painted blue  A canvas vast, unmarked, and true.  I stood within the gentle light  And found myself, at last, in view.For the first time in my life  I felt the earth beneath my feet,  The pulse of roots, the whispering leaves,  The certainty of being here\u2014complete.  No future fear, no shadowed past,  Just this moment\u2014wide and bright.  For the first time in my life,  I knew the meaning of delight."}]}

The world, a tapestry unspun,  Unraveled threads of joy and pain;  I watched the rivers as they run,  And learned to love the gentle rain.  From childhood\u2019s hour I have not known  The easy path, the common song;  Instead, a melody my own\u2014  A place where quiet hearts belong.  Yet in this difference, I have grown,  A garden wild, a sky unseen;  And though I walk this road alone,  I find my peace in what has been."}]}

My God, how many are my fears!  Yet greater still your grace appears."}]}

Brother set against his kin,  Old lives lost so new begin;  A kingdom not of gilded ease,  But justice sung on wounded knees.  His sword was not of tempered steel,  But spirit, sharper still to feel\u2014  It cut through pride, through fear and lies,  And opened blind and stubborn eyes.  So when He comes, do not be cowed  By thunder\u2019s voice or gathering cloud;  For peace is born through struggle, pain\u2014  The sword must fall, and truth must reign."}]}

The paddocks stretch wide to a shimmering haze,  Sun-bleached and brittle and bare,  While the ghost gums stand sentinel, ancient and pale,  In the gold of the outback air.  Here, the days roll like thunder, immense and alone,  And the nights spill with stars overhead,  Each heartbeat a drum in the vastness of space,  Each footstep a story unsaid.  Yet hope is a wildflower, stubborn and bright,  That clings to the cracks in the clay,  And the laughter of magpies at first blush of light  Chases loneliness quietly away.  On a lonely selection far out in the West,  Where the world feels both empty and grand,  A dreamer still tends to the earth and the sky,  And finds home in the sweep of the land."}]}

People are happy, their faces aglow,  Carrying secrets that no one will know.  Smiles like lanterns held high in the night,  Chasing away the shadows of fright.  People are happy, their voices a song,  Dancing together where hearts belong.  Yet in the quiet, when daylight is done,  Longings and worries unravel as one.  People are happy, and maybe it\u2019s true\u2014  In moments of kindness, in skies washed with blue.  In the warmth of a hand, in the hope of a start,  People are happy\u2014in pieces of heart.  So let us be gentle, and let us be kind,  For happiness flickers and changes its mind.  People are happy, and sometimes they\u2019re not\u2014  But joy can be found in the love that we\u2019ve got."}]}

Do hearts hide their sorrows behind painted cheer,  Wishing for someone to quietly hear?Yet still, in the bustle, the music, the crowd,  There\u2019s magic in moments, joy speaking loud.  People are happy, and maybe it\u2019s true\u2014  In laughter and longing, in old and in new.For happiness flickers, it dances, it flies,  A bird on the wing in wide-open skies.  People are happy\u2014today, let it be,  A truth in this moment, for you and for me."}]}

People are happy, in moments, in part\u2014  A patchwork of joy stitched by each fragile heart.So let us be gentle, and cherish the light  That glimmers in laughter and softens the night\u2014  For people are happy, and sometimes that\u2019s true,  A fleeting bright promise, for me and for you."}]}

People are happy in the hush of dawn,  Coffee warming hopeful hands,  Promises whispered before they\u2019re gone,  New beginnings in shifting sands.  People are happy in the smallest ways\u2014  A gentle nod, a shared umbrella,  Sunbeams tangled in ordinary days,  A song remembered, a story retella.  People are happy, sometimes unaware,  Of joy blooming in quiet corners,  Of love that lingers in the open air,  Of peace found in life\u2019s worn borders.  People are happy, and so am I,  Watching the world in its gentle spin,  Finding the reasons, never asking why,  Letting the simple moments in."}]}
