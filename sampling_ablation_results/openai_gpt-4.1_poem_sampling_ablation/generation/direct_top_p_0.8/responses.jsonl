The world felt quiet, holding breath,  Each leaf and blade anew;  The hush of hope, the softest step,  A sky washed clear and blue.For the first time in my life,  I listened to the rain\u2014  Not as a distant, drumming sound,  But singing on the pane.  It told me stories, old and deep,  Of longing, loss, and grace,  And in the music, I could keep  A peace I can\u2019t replace.For the first time in my life,  I let my heart believe  That every ending, every scar,  Has something to achieve.  The world is wide, the path unknown,  Yet standing in this light,  I find the courage to go on\u2014  For the first time in my life."}]}

The drops stitched gentle secrets  Into the fabric of the day,  And I learned to trust the silence  When the words had slipped away.For the first time in my life,  I let the world be new\u2014  Unfolding in its mystery,  In colors raw and true.  I opened up my hands,  Let go of all I knew before,  And found, in that sweet letting go,  A door within a door.For the first time in my life,  I felt the earth beneath my feet,  And realized I\u2019d only just begun  To taste what makes us complete."}]}

While others danced in summer\u2019s light,  I traced the silver of the moon,  And found my solace in the night\u2014  A quiet, haunted, tender tune.  So now, though years have come and gone,  The child within me softly calls;  I follow where the dusk has drawn  Its veil along the shadowed walls.  For in the place where I have been\u2014  Apart, and yet forever near\u2014  I find the beauty born of pain,  And cradle both my hope and fear."}]}

He strode not gently through the crowd,  But thundered justice, fierce and loud;  His eyes like fire, his voice the gale,  He shattered silence, rent the veil.  He overturned the merchant\u2019s wares,  Unmasked the pious, caught their stares;  His parables, sharp as a knife,  Cut through the marrow of our life.  The comforter, the challenger,  He called the rich to give, the poor  To rise and walk, to see and speak,  To claim the strength found in the meek.  Not peace as men would wish to find\u2014  A quiet heart, a tranquil mind\u2014  But peace that battles, peace that bleeds,  That sows the earth with righteous seeds.  On the scene came Christ The Lord,  Bearing not peace, but truth\u2019s own sword\u2014  Dividing darkness from the day,  And calling all to walk His way."}]}

He came not to appease or please,  But rouse the sleeping from their ease.  The sword He bore was not of steel,  But justice none could mute or steal;  It severed lies from honest pain,  And cut the bonds of hate in twain.The world, unsettled by His call,  Saw kingdoms rise and idols fall.  His peace\u2014a cost, His truth\u2014a flame,  That none who met Him left the same.

There are those who fear endings, or never to start,  Or the echo of longing that aches in the heart.Fear wears many faces\u2014of loss, or of change,  Of dreams that seem distant, or futures so strange.  It whispers in quiet, it shouts in the crowd,  It drapes us in worry, a shivering shroud.Yet, within every fear, a lesson is spun:  A courage to gather, a race to be run.  For when we confront what trembles inside,  We find our own strength, no longer to hide.Everyone has a fear, it\u2019s true and it\u2019s clear\u2014  But braving the darkness, we draw our hope near.  With hearts softly trembling, we choose to press on,  And in facing our fears, find the light of the dawn."}]}

It hides in the silence between heartbeats,  In the hush of the night as the city retreats,  Worn in the lines of a trembling hand,  Or the hope in a wish that the world might understand.  Some fears are loud as a thunderous storm,  Others are quiet, a chill barely warm;  They live in the corners we dare not explore,  Locked in the dreams we choose to ignore.  Yet, woven in fear is a thread of grace,  A chance to be gentle, to honor the space  Where courage is born in the trembling chest,  And light finds a way through the places we rest.  For everyone has a fear, it\u2019s true\u2014  But in facing the dark, we discover the view:  That fear is a bridge, not the end of the road,  And hope is the lantern we carry, aglow."}]}

People are happy with hearts softly beating,  With stories that tangle and voices that rise,  With children who dance on the edges of evening,  And lovers who speak with the hush of their eyes.  People are happy, not always with reason,  But sometimes because of the warmth in the air,  The taste of ripe peaches, the changing of seasons,  The knowledge of simply existing, and care.  People are happy, the world keeps on turning,  Each sunrise a canvas, each moment a chance,  To gather up light, to keep searching and learning,  To live in the music, to laugh, and to dance."}]}
