It whispers tales of wrongs untold, of slights endured, of justice lost. A narrative both dark and old, at an immeasurable cost. It coats my thoughts in ash and grime, distorts the world through smoky haze. Trapped in a timeless, bitter clime, through an endless labyrinth of days. I try to douse it, plead and pray, to banish this consuming heat. But it just gathers strength to stay, an uninvited, harsh heartbeat. It feeds on silence, thrives on doubt, a hidden scar, a festering wound. And though I try to shut it out, its fiery breath is all around. A dormant volcano, ready to burst, a tempest brewing, dark and grand. A thirst for vengeance, truly cursed, held captive by my shaking hand.",

It wraps around my weary heart, a constricting, fiery vine. Tearing my very soul apart, making every memory malign. I trace its roots, a tangled thread, back to a moment, long ago. Words unsaid, and tears unshed, a seed of rage I let it sow. Now it\u2019s a furnace, fiercely hot, a crucible where pain is forged. Every kindness I have got, by its dark presence is disgorged.

Of pioneers past, with their dreams and their plight, carving out futures, through day and through night. The mountains stand silent, their shadows so deep, guarding the stories the dry earth does keep. A homestead abandoned, a well long since dry, beneath the vast canvas of a boundless sky. The sun dips in crimson, a fiery farewell, as stars, one by one, their silent tales tell. Of solitude's embrace, a wild, rugged grace, in this untamed corner, a desolate place. Yet beauty resides in the stark, open land, a testament whispered, by nature's own hand. For even in stillness, a spirit takes flight, on a lonely selection, bathed in pale moonlight.",

A lone rider journeys, his spurs softly chime, traversing the canyons, defying all time. The dust devils dance, in the heat of the day, as hopes, like mirages, just fade and give way. He seeks not for riches, nor fame's fleeting gleam, but solace and quiet, a long-cherished dream. The sky stretches endless, a sapphire-blue dome, a universe painted, so far from his home. Each rock and each crevice, a story untold, of struggles and triumphs, both brave and so bold. The coyotes howl mournful, beneath the moon's gaze, echoing silence through sun-drenched haze.

The missed connections, words unsaid, the paths not taken, hopes long dead. Yet even in sorrow, a light can shine, a quiet strength, a purpose divine.

So breathe it in, the bitter and sweet, a journey endless, bittersweet. For every chapter, every line, a part of the person, truly mine.",
