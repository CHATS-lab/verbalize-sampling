It suggests that genuine truth-telling isn't a spontaneous act, but rather the culmination of a dedicated practice of internalizing and understanding. Imagine a scholar, deeply immersed in ancient texts, who only then feels qualified to offer an interpretation. Or a musician, who spends years perfecting their ear, before daring to compose a symphony that truly resonates. This habit of listening implies a humility, a recognition that truth isn't something we impose, but something we uncover. It's a continuous dialogue, where one must first be a diligent student before becoming a confident teacher. The speaker acknowledges that their capacity to articulate truth is directly proportional to their willingness to absorb it, making the act of speaking an extension of a profound internal process. This poem would explore the quietude required for such listening, the patience, and the eventual blossoming of authentic expression that results from this deep connection to reality.\", 'probability': 1.0}",
