My song was one of sorrow sung,A whispered plea within a waking dream.I hugged the shadows, feared the light of day,Believed my worth was measured by my shame.Each step I took, I stumbled on the way,A flickering ember, barely holding flame.But then a spark, a defiant, stubborn glow,Began to burn, though small and weak at first.A memory of strength I used to know,A silent promise, that my bonds would burst.The grovelling stopped, the creature stood upright,Though scarred and bruised, a different form emerged.No longer bound by shadows of the night,A phoenix rising, where the ashes surged.The worm remembered wings, the earth forgot,And soared above the dust, no longer low.The past a shadow, by the present caught,A testament to how a soul can grow.",
