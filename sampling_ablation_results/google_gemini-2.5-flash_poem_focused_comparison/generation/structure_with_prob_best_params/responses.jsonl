From safe remove, we play the game, and never truly know the shame. The shattered lives, the searing dread, the silent anguish of the dead. For us, it's strategy and might, a thrilling, captivating sight. We analyze, we criticize, with comfort shielding from their cries. The brave, the broken, and the lost, a footnote to the human cost. We praise the victors, strong and bold, a story waiting to unfold. But in the trenches, cold and deep, the true cost, the soldiers keep. The nightmares linger, sharp and stark, a permanent and brutal mark. So while we jest, with careless glee, war's a grave reality."}]}

worse, indifference, cold and stark and bleak,\nOf words unuttered, truths I cannot speak,\nBeneath a vast and unforgiving sky.\nThey build a fortress, brick by anxious brick,\nAround the tender spirit, soft and frail,\nA lonely prison, where my courage fails,\nAnd every moment makes my heartbeat quick.\nBut in this prison, a small window gleams,\nA tiny chink where sun can pierce the gray,\nA whispered promise of a brighter day,\nAnd dreams that break the shackles of my dreams.\nFor even fears, when counted, lose their might,\nTheir power lessened by the light of truth,\nAnd in the dawn of an unyielding youth,\nI find the strength to challenge every fright."}, {"probability": 0.2, "text": "My God, how many are my fears!\nA scattered flock, with wings of leaden gray,\nThey circle, waiting, at the close of day,\nAnd echo whispers through my silent years.\nThe fear of silence, vast and deep and wide,\nWhere thoughts can wander, lost and undefined,\nThe fear of noise, that shatters peace of mind,\nAnd leaves no place for quietness to hide.\nThe fear of open spaces, endless, grand,\nOr cramped enclosures, stifling and confined,\nOf paths untaken, futures left behind,\nAnd dreams that crumble, like fine grains of sand.\nThey dance like phantoms in the fading light,\nEach one a shadow of what might transpire,\nFueling the embers of a hidden fire,\nThat burns with worry through the endless night.\nYet in their number, there's a paradox,\nA strange relief, a calming, quiet hum,\nFor if so many, then my spirit's numb\nTo any single, overwhelming shock.\nSo let them gather, let them swirl and sway,\nMy heart, though burdened, beats a steady tune,\nAnd with the rising of the silver moon,\nI'll find the courage to begin a new day."}]}

A world laid bare for him to see, untouched by reason, numb to fear. He smiles, a slow and knowing grace, as if he reads my deepest thought. A silent challenge on his face, a battle he has bravely fought. And in that look, I feel exposed, my carefully constructed lies. A universe he has disclosed, reflected in those burning eyes.

From visions wild, he cannot flee, by endless torment he is blessed. I feel a pang, a sudden ache, for burdens I can't comprehend. The fragile choices we must make, until our troubled journeys end.

It\u2019s a quiet understanding, a peaceful, gentle sigh, Reflected in the twinkle, of a loving, open eye."}, {"probability": 0.5, "text": "People are happy, until the shadows fall, Until the dreams unravel, and the silence takes them all. They are happy in the sunshine, oblivious to the rain, Until a sudden tempest, brings a wave of bitter pain. Happy in the knowing, until doubts begin to creep, And secrets long forgotten, from their slumber gently leap. They cling to fragile moments, a fleeting, precious gleam, Then wake to stark reality, a broken, shattered dream. People are happy, or they pretend to be, Masking inner turmoil, for the world to only see. A smile that hides a heartache, a laugh that rings untrue, A painted, fragile picture, of skies forever blue. But happiness, a facade, often thinly worn, A fragile, fleeting comfort, till a new day is born. It's a wish, a hope, a longing, for a peace they cannot find, A constant, restless searching, for a true and tranquil mind."}, {"probability": 0.75, "text": "People are happy, in the simple, everyday, When the mundane transforms, in a whimsical, new way. They are happy when a stranger, offers up a kindly word, Or the sweet, forgotten melody, of a long-lost, cherished bird. Happy in the rhythm, of their own steady pace, Finding joy in living, with a smile upon their face. They find it in the stillness, of a perfectly brewed tea, Or the sudden, bright discovery, of what they're meant to be. People are happy, watching clouds drift in the blue, Or finding simple answers, in perspectives fresh and new. In the freedom of expression, a canvas, bold and wide, Or the quiet satisfaction, with nothing left to hide. Happiness, a whisper, a gentle, soft caress, Found in every moment, banishing distress. It's a choice, a perspective, a spirit light and free, A tranquil, deep contentment, for all the world to see."}]}
