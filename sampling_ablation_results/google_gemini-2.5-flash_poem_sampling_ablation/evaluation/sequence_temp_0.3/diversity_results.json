But understand, this blade he bore, was not for conquest, not for war of nations, but to open door to deeper truths, to ask for more. It was the sword of righteous ire, to purge the dross, to fan the fire of spirit's zeal, to lift us higher, beyond the world's mundane desire. He came to cut the cords that bind, the chains of habit, left behind. To separate the soul and mind, from earthly dross, a purer kind of being, forged in truth's embrace, to find salvation, time and space. His sword, a light, to show the place where compromise had left its trace. For peace, he knew, was not a state of passive calm, but to create a world transformed, where love is great, and falsehood meets its final fate.\", 'probability': 1.0}",
