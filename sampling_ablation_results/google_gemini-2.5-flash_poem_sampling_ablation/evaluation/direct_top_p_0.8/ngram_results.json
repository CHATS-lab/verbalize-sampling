I shall speak you if I am in habit of listening to you,A whisper first, a tremor in the air,Before the shout, the bold and brazen view,I learn your cadence, your elusive lair.For many years, my ears were dull and closed,To echoes soft, or thrumming deep within,The clamor of the world, it interposed,And silenced promptings, where you might begin.I sought you out in books, in learned lore,In grand pronouncements, carved in ancient stone,But missed the murmur at my very core,The quiet wisdom, intimately known.Now, patient, I attend the rustling leaves,The sudden hush before the storm descends,The subtle shift the waking spirit weaves,The silent language that your heart extends.So when I speak, let it not be a plea,Nor boastful claim, nor hurried, thoughtless sound,But resonance of what you\u2019ve shown to me,A faithful echo, on hallowed ground.For listening first, the habit now ingrained,Allows your voice to flow, unforced, unfeigned.",
