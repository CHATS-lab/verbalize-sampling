I shall speak you if I am in habit of listening to you,A whisper first, a quiet, gentle plea.For often do I shout, and often do I sue,But seldom do I bend a knee to thee.My ears are stuffed with clamor, loud and bold,The siren song of comfort, soft and deep.The tales I weave, the fictions I have sold,While your still voice, unheard, begins to sleep.Yet sometimes, in the hush of fading day,When shadows lengthen, and the world grows still,A tremor runs, a doubt begins to play,And then, your presence, subtle, starts to fill.A sudden clarity, a piercing ray,Through tangled thoughts, a path begins to gleam.And in that moment, I begin to pray,To shed the dross, and wake from every dream.So teach me, Truth, to quiet my own din,To sift the chaff, and find the honest grain.For only then, will your clear words beginTo echo forth, and purge away the pain.Then, from my lips, you'll flow, a living stream,No longer bound by habit's heavy chain.",
