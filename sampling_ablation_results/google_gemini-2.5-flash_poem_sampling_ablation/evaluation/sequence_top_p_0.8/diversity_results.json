A fear of silence, or the coming dark, of losing grip, or losing all control. The artist fears the canvas, stark and white, the writer dreads the page, a barren land. The lover fears the fading of the light, the touch that slips from an unholding hand. The child, the monster lurking 'neath the bed, the elder, time that swiftly slips away. A silent dread, uncomfortably spread, that haunts our waking and our sleeping day. Yet in this shared vulnerability, a strange connection, fragile and profound. We see ourselves in others' agony, on common ground, where solace can be found. For knowing this, we walk a little softer, with empathy for burdens others bear. The fear that chills, also makes us fonder, of human bonds, and comfort we can share.\", 'probability': 1.0}",

The world above, a blur of light, of soaring birds and azure skies, remained beyond my humble sight, reflected only in my eyes as murky shadows, indistinct. I knew no hunger for the breeze, nor longed for peaks, by sunbeams kissed, just rooted deep among the trees, by humble, earthy scents caressed.
