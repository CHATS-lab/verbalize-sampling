I shall speak you if I am in habit of listening to you,A whisper first, then a murmur, a tide that softly grew.For silence often cloaks the mind, a shroud of easy lies,And comfort weaves its silken threads, obscuring honest skies.I\u2019ve walked the paths of quietude, where echoes softly fade,And let the world\u2019s cacophony, my inner voice invade.The clamor of convenience, the hum of what is known,Has often drowned the subtle call, the seeds of truth unsown.But now, a shift, a gentle turn, a leaning to the ear,To catch the rustle of your cloak, the message drawing near.No longer just a fleeting thought, a shadow in the night,But something sought, a guiding star, a beacon burning bright.For how can I articulate, the essence of your form,If I\u2019ve not felt your steady hand, through sunshine and through storm?So let me learn your cadence, Truth, your rhythm and your grace,And then, with voice unwavering, I\u2019ll find your rightful place.To speak you not as duty bound, but as a breath I take,A natural, vital utterance, for honesty\u2019s own sake.",

            "response": "Truth! I shall speak you if I am in habit of listening to you,A whisper first, then a murmur, a tide that softly grew.For years I walked in shadows, where echoes softly played,Believing tales of comfort, by gentle fictions swayed.My ears were tuned to flattery, to what the world desired,A symphony of solace, by self-deception fired.I built a gilded cage, with bars of pleasant lies,And wondered why the sunlight felt distant from my eyes.But then a tremor started, a crack within the pane,A quiet, insistent hum, like falling, gentle rain.It wasn't loud or jarring, no thunder in the sky,Just a persistent presence, a question in my eye.And as I leaned in closer, to catch that subtle sound,The clamor of my fictions began to lose its ground.The habit formed, not speaking, but hearing what was real,The quiet, steady rhythm, the truth I could now feel.So now, when words are forming, and thoughts begin to bloom,I check if I've been listening, dispelling inner gloom.For only then, with purpose, and clarity anew,Can I truly speak you, Truth, if I am listening to you.",
