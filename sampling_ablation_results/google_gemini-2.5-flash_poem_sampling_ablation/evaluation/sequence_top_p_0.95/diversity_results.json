A constant hum beneath the skin, a tremor felt, but rarely seen. It holds the past, where it has been, and shapes the future, sharp and keen. It's not a shout, a sudden roar, but slow erosion, day by day. Wearing down the spirit's core, in its relentless, silent way. It colors vision, dims the light, a heavy shroud upon the mind. Turning vibrant day to night, leaving solace far behind. It clings to memory's fragile thread, a constant companion, ever near. A thousand things that went unsaid, fueling its patient, burning fear. Oh, how it yearns to find its peace, to dissipate, to fade away. But tightly bound, it finds no ease, a captive of yesterday.\", 'probability': 1.0}",
