This sword, a metaphor profound, for change that shakes the very ground. It severs ties, it breaks apart, the hardened shell around the heart. No earthly weapon, cold and grim, but spirit's fire, from Him. To cut through apathy and vice, to make the ultimate sacrifice. His peace demands a broken will, a climb up Calvary's lonely hill. The sword of truth, a painful grace, revealing every hidden place. For unity, a deeper bond, beyond the world, a new beyond. This cutting edge, a holy tool, to free the soul from folly's rule. A necessary, sharp divide, where only truth can now abide.",

I crawled through barren landscapes, beneath a sky of grey,  Believing every whisper that told me I must stay.  My heart, a shriveled raisin, my mind, a tangled thread,  I built my world on pity, on words that others said.  But then a spark, a flicker, a whisper from within,  A tiny, fragile courage, where courage hadn't been.  It grew, a quiet ember, then blazed into a flame,  And showed me that the darkness was not my given name.  I rose, not with a roar, but with a steady, silent climb,  Leaving the grovelling creature to the relentless march of time.  Now sunlight warms my shoulders, the wind sings in my hair,  And though the scars remain, they whisper, 'You are here.'",

My eyes were fixed on footprints, on paths I dared not stray,  Content to chew on crumbs, and simply waste away.  No grand ambition stirred me, no whisper of a flight,  Just endless, muted yearning for the fading of the light.  But then a sudden tremor, a crack within the stone,  A tiny, insistent yearning to stand completely alone.  I felt the sun upon me, a warmth I'd never known,  And shed the skin of weakness, the seeds of strength were sown.  The grovelling creature vanished, a ghost of what had been,  Replaced by one who gazes at horizons, sharp and keen.  The chains that bound my spirit, they crumbled into dust,  And now I walk upright, my future built on trust.",

But then a distant thunder, a rumbling in the ground,  A primal, fierce awakening, a long-forgotten sound.  It shook the very foundations of the fear I held so dear,  And showed me that the weakness was merely a veneer.  The grovelling creature faded, a memory, soft and dim,  As I embraced the tempest, and learned to truly swim.

But then a tiny fissure, a crack within the wall,  A sliver of the sunlight, a chance to stand up tall.  It beckoned me to venture, beyond the known and safe,  To break the self-made prison, and truly learn to chafe.  The grovelling creature faltered, then stumbled, and then fell,  As I stepped into the vastness, escaping from my hell.  Now boundless skies embrace me, and winds declare my name,  No longer a mere shadow, but burning with a flame.",

But then a sudden lifting, a curious, gentle hand,  Transported me to vistas, across a wondrous land.  The grovelling creature vanished, a speck beneath the sky,  As I beheld the cosmos, and learned to truly fly.  No longer bound by instinct, or limited by sight,  I soared above the valleys, bathed in ethereal light.  The old self is a whisper, a distant, fading sound,  As new horizons beckon, on hallowed, sacred ground.",
