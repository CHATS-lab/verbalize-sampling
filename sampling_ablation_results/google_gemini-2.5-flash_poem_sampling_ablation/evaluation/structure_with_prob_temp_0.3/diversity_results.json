A dream of justice, long denied, a truth that cannot be defied. It pulses low, a rhythmic beat, beneath my calm, composed facade. It fuels the words I long to speak, the battles I have never fought. It's a slow-burning, steady heat, a lesson that I've dearly bought. I feel its warmth, its subtle might, a guiding star in darkest night. It shapes my purpose, sharpens gaze, through life's bewildering, winding maze. This anger burns, a sacred flame, whispering a forgotten name. It's not destructive, not a curse, but a profound, internal force. A catalyst for change, I find, a powerful, determined mind. It's the engine of my silent fight, illuminating wrong from right.

It\u2019s born of injustice, a righteous ire, a silent, unyielding, inner fire. It simmers beneath a calm facade, a quiet rebellion, subtly played. It\u2019s the strength to stand, to not give in, to fight for what\u2019s right, from deep within. It\u2019s a protective shield, a warning sign, a boundary drawn, distinctly mine. It fuels the passion, sharpens the wit, a powerful force, I must admit. It\u2019s not about vengeance, or bitter strife, but a fierce affirmation of life. This anger, deep, a sacred trust, turns weakness into powerful thrust.",
