It's not the swift fury of a storm, but the grinding pressure of tectonic plates, building tension beneath the calm facade. It doesn't scream, but vibrates, a low frequency hum that resonates through every fiber of being. It's a silent testament to injustices endured, to voices unheard, to dignity trampled. It colors perception, casting a pall over optimism, making skepticism a default lens. It manifests as a quiet determination, a steeling of the will, a refusal to crumble. It\u2019s a constant companion, a heavy anchor tethering the present to a painful past. It whispers of caution, of self-reliance, of the enduring scar tissue of wounds unhealed. This anger, it doesn't seek destruction, but transformation; a slow, agonizing metamorphosis driven by the relentless heat of grievance, forging resilience from the very core of resentment, a silent, internal revolution.\", 'probability': 1.0}",
