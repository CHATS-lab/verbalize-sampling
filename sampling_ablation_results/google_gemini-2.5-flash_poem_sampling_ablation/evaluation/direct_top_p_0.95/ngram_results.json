I shall speak you if I am in habit of listening to you,a whisper in the bustling market, a silent, knowing view.For many years, I chased the echo, a phantom, fleeting sound,believing it resided always on some distant, hallowed ground.I sought you in the fervent sermon, the scholar's weighty tome,in ancient, cracked philosophies, far from my simple home.I polished clever arguments, a mirror for the light,but often found myself reflecting only shades of night.Then came the quiet turning, a stillness in the din,a recognition of the voice that lived and breathed within.Not thundering pronouncements, nor dazzling, sudden gleam,but patient, steady cadence, like a half-remembered dream.It spoke through honest sorrow, the joy that swelled and broke,in patterns of the seasons, the words the spirit spoke.No longer just a stranger, a concept to pursue,but woven in the fabric, the very core of \"you.\"So now, when doubt assails me, or shadows start to creep,I pause, and draw a breath, and listen, still and deep.For truth is not a treasure found, but presence, ever near,and speaking it becomes the act of banishing all fear.",
