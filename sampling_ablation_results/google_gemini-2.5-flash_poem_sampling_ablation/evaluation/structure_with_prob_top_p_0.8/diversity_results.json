A quiet hum, a subtle thrum, beneath the surface, out of sight. It waits for moments to succumb, to burst forth in the darkest night. It paints my thoughts in crimson hues, a bitter taste upon my tongue. It twists the truth, distorts the news, from ancient wrongs, forever young. I feel its tendrils, sharp and keen, embrace my heart, a thorny vine. A constant, suffocating scene, where peace and solace can't entwine. I long for calm, a gentle breeze, to sweep away this fiery haze. To find release, to be at ease, and navigate through sunnier days. But still it smolders, ever near, a watchful, ever-present guard. A silent, ever-present fear, my spirit scarred, forever hard.",

A constellation, vast and bright,Each one a star, through endless years,That twinkles in the darkest night.The fear of love, its fragile hold,Of hearts that break, and vows that fade,A story often left untold,A promise silently betrayed.The fear of joy, its fleeting grace,That lingers only for a while,A smile that vanishes from face,A moment lost, a weary mile.The fear of truth, its naked sting,Of what lies hidden, deep inside,The bitter lessons life can bring,Where honest feelings often hide.But in this fear, a gentle plea,A yearning for what's pure and kind,To set my burdened spirit free,And leave the anxious thoughts behind.For even fear can teach and guide,A path to growth, a deeper grace,Where inner peace can now abide,And find its true and rightful place.",

What twisted thoughts does he enshrine, what phantoms whisper near? The air grows thick with unspoken threat, a tension I can't break. I stand transfixed, no longer met by kindness, for goodness sake. Just madness, raw and undiluted, reflected in his gaze. A silent scream, unprosecuted, lost in these endless days.

Empty storefronts gaze, with vacant despair, at dust-covered memories, hanging in air. The gallows stand stark, a grim silhouette, of justice once dealt, and lives to regret. A tumbleweed rolls, through streets once so grand, a symbol of dreams, lost in the sand. The wind hums a tune, a desolate plea, for fortunes that vanished, for all eyes to see. No miner's pick rings, no gambler's loud shout, just silence and shadows, all scattered about. The spirit of boomtown, now faded and dim, a testament to time, and life's fleeting whim. This desolate spot, a story untold, of hope and ambition, both brave and bold. A silent museum, of days that have passed, where echoes of history, forever will last.",
