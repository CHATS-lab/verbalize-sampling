A furnace stoked by slights untold, by whispered words and broken trust, a story etched in shadows old, now turning everything to dust. It flickers low, a smoldering coal, then flares anew with sudden might, consuming peace, taking its toll, a suffocating, endless night. No outward flame, no violent roar, just quiet heat that leaves its mark, corroding all I held before, leaving only scars within the dark. And though I strive to quell its fire, to douse the embers, make them cease, it fuels a desperate, dark desire, denying solace, robbing peace. A constant hum, a subtle ache, a poison seeping through my veins, for every breath I try to take, this burning anger still remains.",

I trace its contours, feel its searing kiss, a strange companion, in this dark abyss. It lends a sharpness, to my every glance, a brittle armor, taking every chance. To keep the world at bay, to hold it far, a burning barrier, a self-inflicted scar. I yearn to pluck it, cast it to the air, but its roots run deeper, beyond all repair. So I endure it, this consuming blaze, lost in its labyrinth, through endless, fiery days.",

The eagles soar high, on currents of air, surveying their kingdom, beyond all compare. Wildflowers bloom in defiance of heat, a tapestry vibrant, exquisitely sweet. No human voice breaks the silence profound, just nature's own symphony, all around. The scent of sagebrush, a pungent perfume, dispelling the shadows, and chasing the gloom. Here, the soul finds its rhythm, untroubled and free, in harmony with what's meant to be. The vast, empty spaces, a balm to the mind, leaving the worries of mankind behind. This remote sanctuary, a haven of peace, where burdens are lifted, and anxieties cease. A place to reflect, and to simply just be, under the wide, endless, Western decree.",

Empty storefronts gaze, with vacant despair, at dust-covered memories, hanging in air. The gallows stand stark, a grim silhouette, of justice once dealt, and lives to regret. A tumbleweed rolls, through streets once so grand, a symbol of dreams, lost in the sand. The wind hums a tune, a desolate plea, for fortunes that vanished, for all eyes to see. No miner's pick rings, no gambler's loud shout, just silence and shadows, all scattered about. The spirit of boomtown, now faded and dim, a testament to time, and life's fleeting whim. This desolate spot, a story untold, of hope and ambition, both brave and bold. A silent museum, of days that have passed, where echoes of history, forever will last.",
