The mundane world, a distant hum, awaiting what was yet to come. A future forged, by inner fire, fueled by an unfulfilled desire.

And in that gaze, a mirror I perceive, a fragile line between the sane and wild, a truth that makes my very spirit grieve, for reason's fortress, easily beguiled. That maddened gaze, a story yet unspun, a universe of terror, vast and deep, a battle lost before it's even begun, a secret that his haunted mind will keep.\", 'probability': 1.0}",
