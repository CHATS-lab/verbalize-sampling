It\u2019s not the loud rage, that breaks and destroys, but a quiet resentment, that subtly annoys. It gathers its strength, in the quiet of night, dimming the hope, and obscuring the light. It\u2019s a slow-acting poison, a corrosive stream, eroding the edges of every bright dream. It clings to the heart, a parasitic vine, making the spirit subtly decline. A captive emotion, tightly bound, unable to escape, from this desolate ground. It yearns for release, for a cleansing rain, to wash away sorrow, to soothe the deep pain. But the fire persists, a stubborn, fierce glow, a constant reminder of seeds that will grow.",

Not malice, no, nor dark intent, but sorrow deep and vast, a spirit utterly unbent, by shadows from the past. His gaze, a window to a soul, besieged by inner strife, a broken, unmade, weary whole, adrift upon the life. I see the pain, the silent cries, the battles fought within, beneath those wild, tormented eyes, where hope has worn too thin. And in that gaze, a burden shared, a weight I cannot flee, for compassion, unprepared, now settles over me. A silent promise, soft and low, to listen to his plea, to offer comfort, let him know, he's not alone, you see.",

Its windows like eyes, staring blankly ahead, at mountains that slumber, where wild spirits tread. The creak of the door, though no one is near, echoes the silence, banishing fear. For here, in the quiet, the land holds its breath, a testament strong, defying even death. The sagebrush and tumbleweed dance in the breeze, through canyons and mesas, among the old trees.

No fences, no pathways, just raw, open land, a brushstroke of wildness, by nature's own hand. A stream, silver ribbon, meanders so slow, reflecting the stars, as the night starts to grow. The scent of pine needles, a deep, earthy balm, brings solace and peace, like a whispered-soft psalm. The wind, it hums softly, a desolate tune, beneath the cold watch of the crescent moon.

To walk again through hallowed halls, responding to memory's calls. Not to dwell, but to perceive, the beauty that our souls believe. For in that journey, we can see, the path to our true destiny.",
