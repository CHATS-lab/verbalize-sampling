It whispers in the quiet moments, a low hum beneath the surface of my calm, reminding me of injustices unaddressed, words unspoken, and betrayals unatonled. It tints my perception, a filter of simmering resentment that subtly colors the world. Sometimes, I fear it will consume me, this internal inferno, leaving nothing but ash and a hollow echo where my heart once beat. Yet, strangely, it also fuels me, a fierce guardian against further wounding, a silent promise of resilience in the face of adversity. It is a burden, yes, but also a strange, uncomfortable strength, a constant companion in the landscape of my soul.",

It carves unseen channels through the bedrock of my being, shaping the contours of my emotional landscape. It isn't the kind of anger that explodes in shouts or violent gestures; rather, it is a quiet, relentless pressure, building steadily beneath the surface. It manifests as a tight knot in my stomach, a persistent clenching in my jaw, a constant vigilance against perceived slights. I try to contain it, to build dams and diversions, but its force is immense, always threatening to breach the barriers. I often wonder what would happen if it ever broke free, if this contained inferno were unleashed. Would it destroy everything in its path, or would it, perhaps, clear the way for something new, something less burdened by its weight?",
