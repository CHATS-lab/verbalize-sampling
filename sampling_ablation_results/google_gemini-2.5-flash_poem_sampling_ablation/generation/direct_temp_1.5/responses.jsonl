I shall speak you if I am in habit of listening to you,a quiet echo, often unheard,in the cacophony of what is new,a whisper, not a shouted word.For many years, my ears were shut,to your soft pleas, your subtle guide.I carved my path, then hit a rut,with nothing left for me to hide.I sought for solace, then for peace,in echoes of a louder throng.But found that comfort brought no ease,where what felt right was often wrong.Now, in the quiet, I incline,my head to catch your fleeting grace.A habit formed, a slow design,to find you in this crowded space.And if I learn to truly hear,the gentle rhythm of your beat,then speaking you, without all fear,will make my life profoundly sweet.For truth, once found, becomes the tongue,a melody, both clear and strong."}]}
