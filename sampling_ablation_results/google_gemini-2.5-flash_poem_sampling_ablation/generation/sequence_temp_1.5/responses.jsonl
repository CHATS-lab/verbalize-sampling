sight,Replaced by verdant meadows, bathed in golden light.The burdens I had carried, like stones within my hand,Dissolved to dust and vanished, across a shifting sand.A melody unwritten, began to softly play,Washing doubts and shadows, of every yesterday.No longer bound by limits, I soared on wings unseen,A butterfly emerging, from a chrysalis pristine.The world, a vibrant canvas, where hues began to gleam,Awakened from a slumber, a long-forgotten dream.For the first time in my life, I truly learned to breathe,A tapestry of moments, that I could interweave.With threads of pure
