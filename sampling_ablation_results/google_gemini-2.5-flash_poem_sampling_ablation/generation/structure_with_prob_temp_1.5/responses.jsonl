The fear of loneliness profound, of voices lost within the air, the fear of never being found, or found, and met with vacant stare. They whisper doubts, they plant the seed, of what could falter, what could break, a hungry, ceaseless, pressing need, for answers that I cannot make.

The fear of change, a sweeping tide, that pulls me from the known and warm, the fear of having naught to hide, of weathering life's bitter storm. They cling like moss upon a stone, these worries, etched within my soul, a harvest that my mind has sown, beyond my power to control.

They gather round, a ghostly host, each one a whisper, soft and low, of what is cherished, valued most, and all the things I'll never know. The fear of loss, a chilling dread, of empty spaces, cold and vast, the fear of paths I've left unled, and moments that were built to last. A heavy weight upon my chest, these phantom pains, a constant hum, yet in this anxious, weary quest, I pray for courage yet to come."}]}
