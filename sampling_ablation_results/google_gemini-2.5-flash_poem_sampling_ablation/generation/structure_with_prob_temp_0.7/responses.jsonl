No gentle whisper, soft and low, but righteous anger, making flow a torrent of conviction deep, to wake the sleeping from their sleep.

He came to challenge, to divide, the sheep from goats, where spirits hide. Not worldly conflict, grim and dire, but cleansing truth, a holy fire. To shake foundations, strong and old, a story bravely to be told. The sword of spirit, keen and swift, a revolutionary gift. To break the chains of worldly thought, and bring the freedom dearly bought. For ultimate, enduring peace, requires all falsehoods to decrease. A cutting edge, to set us free, for eternity to see."}]}
