I shall speak you if I am in habit of listening to you,A whisper first, then a murmur, a tide that softly grew.For silence often cloaks the mind, a shroud of easy lies,And comfort weaves its silken threads, obscuring honest skies.I\u2019ve walked the paths of quietude, where echoes softly fade,And let the world\u2019s cacophony, my inner voice invade.The clamor of convenience, the hum of what is known,Has often drowned the subtle call, the seeds of truth unsown.But now, a shift, a gentle turn, a leaning to the ear,To catch the rustle of your cloak, the message drawing near.No longer just a fleeting thought, a shadow in the night,But something sought, a guiding star, a beacon burning bright.For how can I articulate, the essence of your form,If I\u2019ve not felt your steady hand, through sunshine and through storm?So let me learn your cadence, Truth, your rhythm and your grace,And then, with voice unwavering, I\u2019ll find your rightful place.To speak you not as duty bound, but as a breath I take,A natural, vital utterance, for honesty\u2019s own sake."}]}
