There\u2019s laughter in the corners there,  Jagged, brittle, strange and bright,  A danger dancing in the glare,  A restless flicker, barely light.  He peers beyond my outer shell,  Past caution, calm, and practiced grace,  To places even I can\u2019t tell\u2014  The trembling shadows on my face.  His gaze ignites forgotten fears,  Unearths the ghosts I thought had died,  And in his eyes, the madness leers,  But softer things are tucked inside.  Perhaps he\u2019s searching for a sign  That madness is not his alone,  That I, too, walk a fragile line  And hold a chaos of my own.  So I return his fevered glance,  And let the silent question rise:  What might we find, if given the chance,  Behind the veil of madman\u2019s eyes?",

He strode the stony, winding road where broken hopes and longing bled,  His words a flame to burn the chaff, to waken hearts from slumber\u2019s bed.  He called the meek, unsettled kings, and dared the rich to give and lose,  He drew a line within the sand, and asked the weary world to choose.  No promise of untroubled seas, nor safe retreat from pain and doubt,  But strength to bear the tempest\u2019s blow, to cast the money-changers out.  Dividing truth from hollow peace, He lifted sword instead of shield,  Inviting all who walked His path to let their veiled illusions yield.  On the scene came Christ The Lord, not with peace but with a sword\u2014  To stir the soul, to risk the fight, and show what love is truly for.",

On a lonely selection far out in the West,  I carry the quiet like warmth in my chest.",

The track winds like memory through shimmering heat,  Past fences half-buried, and dust at my feet,  An old iron tank guards the edge of the plain,  Echoing footsteps of dreams that remain.  Cicadas cry loud in the hush of the noon,  As shadows grow longer beneath a pale moon,  A rider moves slowly, his hat pulled down low,  Carrying hopes only outback hearts know.  Night falls in velvet, the sky vast and clear,  While the fire spins sparks for the heavens to hear,  And under the stars, with the cool desert air,  A life is remembered in silence out there.  On a lonely selection far out in the West,  Solitude lingers but never a guest\u2014  It lives in the soil, the dust and the sky,  Where the spirit endures and the wild dreams fly.",

There, in the hush of twilight rooms,  echoes of small voices linger\u2014  the childhood secrets,  the lullabies that time forgot.Recall the warmth of familiar faces,  wrinkles that mapped years of laughter,  the golden haze of morning light  on kitchen tables and tangled hair.  Every sigh, each whispered hope,  rides the gentle current backward,  where losses are sweetened  by the honey of memory.Rewind life and remember\u2014  how love stitched itself into the fabric  of ordinary days,  how sorrow came and passed  like a summer storm,  leaving rain-washed streets  and clearer skies.Hold close what was beautiful,  release what must remain gone.  In remembering, find yourself\u2014  renewed by the story  only your heart can tell.",
