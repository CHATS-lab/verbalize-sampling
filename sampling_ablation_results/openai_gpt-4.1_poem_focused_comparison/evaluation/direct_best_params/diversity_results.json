Yet in this difference I have found  A beauty woven through my days\u2014  A melody, a haunting sound,  A guiding hand in shadowed ways.  So let me walk this path unseen,  Where dusk and dawn together lean\u2014  From childhood\u2019s hour I have not been  Quite of this world\u2014and that\u2019s my sheen.",

So let the others chase the light;  I\u2019ll find my path through starry night.  For from that earliest, quiet hour,  I grew apart\u2014yet grew in power.",

He turned the tables, cracked the stone,  Called the lost and walked alone;  Cloaked in mercy, eyes aflame,  He spoke in fire, not in shame.  He called the proud to reckon fear,  And drew the humble ever near;  His sword a sign, His cross the cost\u2014  In every gain, a treasure lost.  No easy peace, no gentle dawn,  But storms to wash the old hopes gone;  He brought the sword that cleaves the heart,  Divides the soul, demands a start.  O children, choose the path you tread\u2014  Follow where His footsteps led:  For peace is found beyond the fray,  Where love has carved the narrow way.",

A sword to sever night from day,  To pierce the veils we drape in gray;  He called the meek, the proud, the lost,  And asked each soul to count the cost.  His words ignited ancient strife,  Set love against the old, safe life;  With every parable and breath,  He waged a war on fear and death.  So do not think His path was sweet\u2014  It cut a line through every street,  And those who choose to walk His way  Still feel the sword\u2019s divide today:  Not for the sake of wrath or pride,  But that the truth might not be denied,  And in the furnace of His word,  A brighter, braver peace is stirred.",

      "response": "On a lonely selection far out in the West,  Where the red dust drifts and the wild winds rest,  The sunlight dances on ochre and stone,  And silence keeps watch for the hearts alone.  A shack stands crooked, its boards bleached and worn,  Sheltering dreams that the city has scorned;  A kettle hums softly with memories steeped  Of laughter long vanished and promises deep.  Here, shadows grow long in the amber-gold light,  And the sky unfolds stories each lingering night;  Magpies and currawongs herald the dawn,  While hope, like the gum trees, grows stubborn and strong.  Hands rough with labor, eyes gentle and wise,  Trace the far ridge where tomorrow might rise;  With patience as endless as sunburnt expanse,  They weather the seasons, and trust in their chance.  On a lonely selection far out in the West,  The spirit endures in each solitary guest;  Though distance and silence may cradle their pain,  They find in the vastness a reason\u2014remain.",
