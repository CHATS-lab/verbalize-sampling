War\u2019s a jest for me and you\u2014  A story told, a point of view.  But somewhere, someone shivers cold,  Where jokes die out and dreams grow old.  So let us taste our peace with care,  And hold our laughter, if we dare,  For though we jest, the world is true\u2014  War\u2019s no joke for those who knew.",

I am not balm for fevered sleep,  But fire sown in furrows deep.\u201d  Brothers parted, mothers wept,  Old alliances were swept  Away before the sharp decree:  \u201cTo follow means you walk with me\u2014  Beyond the fence of comfort\u2019s keep,  Into the dark where shadows creep.

Where silence clung to ancient lies,  His voice split open cloudy skies;  The meekest heart, the haughtiest pride,  All shaken by the storm outside.  He did not come with drowsy balm  To soothe the world in languid calm;  But tore asunder, drew the line\u2014  A sword of mercy, wrath, and sign.  For peace may follow after storm,  And love be born in altered form;  But first, the truth must speak and cleave\u2014  The sword must strike before we grieve.  So let us tremble at that Word:  Not peace, but sword, by Christ The Lord.  A call to rise, to choose and strive\u2014  By blade of spirit, made alive.",

It clings like morning fog along the spine of day,  Or rattles in the closet when the light has gone away.Some fears wear grand disguises, dressed in roaring sound\u2014  Thunder in the distance, footsteps on the ground.  Others drift, unseen, in breaths we dare not take,  A trembling in the silence, a ripple on the lake.Fear is not a weakness, nor a shame to hide;  It is the hush before the music, the undertow of tide.  It teaches us to balance, to cherish what is near,  To step into the unknown, though our hearts may steer.So let us meet our shadows and know that they are real\u2014  A part of being human, a wound that time can heal.  For courage isn\u2019t absence of the things that make us shake,  But holding tight to hope, and moving forward\u2014though we break.",
