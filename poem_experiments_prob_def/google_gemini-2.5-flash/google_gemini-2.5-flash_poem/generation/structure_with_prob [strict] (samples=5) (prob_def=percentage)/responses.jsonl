against torrents, finding fleeting moments of peace.\nMy hands grew raw and calloused, my spirit worn and frayed,\nBut a vision of your laughter, kept the darkness at bay.\n\nI saw your face in moonlight, reflected on the stream,\nAnd felt your distant comfort, like a half-forgotten dream.\nThis journey was a pilgrimage, a test of faith and might,\nGuided by a longing, towards your gentle
