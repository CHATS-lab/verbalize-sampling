The stars, cold and precise, etch epitaphs in Morse across the vault of heaven. We gather not to bury, but to release: a soul, a sigh, a story folded into the dark. Lanterns dangle from bare branches, glowing like captured fireflies, each flame a fragment of what was loved. A violin hums a single note, sustained, trembling\u2014then gone. Footsteps falter on gravel, echoing like heartbeats fading. There are no tears. Tears are daylight things, sharp and visible. Here, grief is deeper, a slow river beneath permafrost. The casket, black as obsidian, absorbs the dim light, refusing to reflect anything but absence. Yet, from within, a faint blue shimmer\u2014perhaps imagination, perhaps spirit\u2014flickers once. Then rises. Not up, but outward, into the net of constellations. We do not say goodbye. We say: go. Go where shadows dance with light, where silence sings, where the night does not end, but unfolds. And when we turn away, the earth breathes easier, knowing it has not lost, but welcomed home.",

No coffin lowered\u2014she willed her body to the crows, to the teeth of the wild. We stood in a half-circle, hands clasped not in prayer, but in defiance of loneliness. Above, Orion aimed his belt at the horizon, indifferent. But the crows came. Not one or two, but dozens, landing in solemn rows on the skeletal arms of oaks. They didn\u2019t caw. They waited. And when the final amen dissolved, they took flight\u2014not in chaos, but in spiral, a living helix rising into the abyss. In that moment, she wasn\u2019t gone. She was becoming: wing, wind, wilderness. The night did not grieve. It transformed. And we, mere witnesses, felt the ancient truth ripple through us\u2014death is not a full stop, but a comma in the breath of the universe. We walked away lighter, not because we\u2019d let go, but because we\u2019d been let in. The darkness no longer feared us. We were part of its hymn now.",

It folds into the earth like a letter sent to no address. Mourners place inkwells in the soil, pens with broken nibs, a thesaurus bloated with rain. One child sets down a flashlight, its beam cutting the dark like a verse. As they leave, the wind stirs pages long buried\u2014her words, perhaps, or just leaves pretending. But in the silence, someone swears they hear a rhyme forming in the roots below. Not sorrow, not solace\u2014just continuity. The night does not mourn poets. It adopts them.

That petal, no longer perfect, was picked up by small hands and glued to paper. 'For Mom,' it read. And in that gesture\u2014imperfect, heartfelt, human\u2014the rose found its purpose.

Not chance, but call.\nThe river knew. It knew through all.",
