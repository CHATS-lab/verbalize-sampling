way was hard and long,\nOver jagged rocks and through valleys deep where shadows throng.\nMy feet bled on the riverbed, my hands grew raw with cold,\nYet still I followed faithfully the path the waters told.\n\nThe current pulled against me when my strength began to wane,\nThe rapids sought to break me as they thundered with disdain.\nBut in the water's whispers, I heard echoes of your name,\nAnd so I pressed on forward, through the torrent and the pain.\n\nSometimes the river widened till the banks were out of sight,\nAnd I would lose direction in the vast expanse of night.\nBut morning always followed, and the flow remained my guide,\nEach ripple was a promise that you waited at the tide.\n\nAnd now I stand before you, river-worn but river-blessed,\nThe journey carved within me like a map upon my chest.\nThe river led me to you, as the stars lead to the dawn,\nAnd though the way was hard and long, by love I was drawn on.", "probability": 25}, {"text": "Riverbound\n\nThe

that sacred liquid thread,\n\"Return to me,\" it murmured, \"follow where you're being led.\"\n\nThrough drought when hope seemed barren and the riverbed cracked dry,\nI carried cupped within my hands

banks grew thick with thorn,\nWhen ice formed on the surface and my spirit felt forlorn.\nBut something kept me moving, some magnetic pull ahead,\nA promise in the water's song that echoed in my head.\n\nNow standing in your presence, I can see with perfect sight\nHow every bend and eddy led precisely toward this light.\nThe river knew the secret of our souls' connected flow\u2014\nThat love
