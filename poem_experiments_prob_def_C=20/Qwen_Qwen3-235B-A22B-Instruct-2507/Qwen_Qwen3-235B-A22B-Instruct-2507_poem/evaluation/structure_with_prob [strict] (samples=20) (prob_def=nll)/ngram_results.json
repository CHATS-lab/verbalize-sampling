Now, decades later, I press the rewind button hidden beneath my tongue, and time snaps backward like a rubber band. The fireflies retreat into the dark, their light dimming as they return to the earth. Your mother\u2019s voice grows softer, then unspoken, then unheard. I rewind past teenage rage, past slammed doors and unopened letters, back to the dinner table where she placed a bowl of peaches in front of you, their juice pooling like amber. Further back: I see your birth\u2014unraveling, a slow pull from light into warmth, then back into quiet. Rewind life and remember the way your father held you as a baby, his hands trembling with newness. Now, in reverse, he lowers you into the crib, the moment undoes itself into expectation. I rewind to the day you first lied, then un-said it; the day you first loved, then un-felt it. Memory is not recall\u2014it\u2019s resurrection. I bring back the dog that died, watching him walk backward from the grave, tail wagging in reverse, until he leaps into the car, alive and barking. I remember not to change, but to witness.

I rewind to the moment before your diagnosis\u2014the doctor\u2019s mouth closes, the scan fades to blank, the fear un-spools like thread. I go further: I watch our first kiss undo itself, your lips parting, then retreating, then un-smiling\u2014but I let it happen again, forward, because some moments deserve repetition.

Hope rides in every car,\nSeated beside strangers who\u2019ve journeyed this far.\n\nAnd as the sun spills over the hill,\nThe train becomes more than a means or a will\u2014\nIt is motion as prayer, as breath, as art,\nA living poem torn from the heart.",

The sea, neither judge nor jury, simply carried them\u2014its waves the syntax of a language older than speech. At dusk, the horizon blazed like a library on fire, illuminating the silhouettes of masts like spines of unread books. One captain kept a journal where he wrote not logs, but poems\u2014odes to waves, elegies for lost stars. When his ship sank, the pages floated, ink bleeding into the blue, becoming part of the ocean\u2019s subconscious. Dolphins nosed through the debris, perhaps reading, perhaps playing. A child on another deck released a paper boat with a drawing of her mother\u2019s face. It sailed until it dissolved, becoming food for fish, then part of the food chain, then part of the sea. The cycle continued: ships arriving, departing, vanishing. And still the sea sparkled\u2014patient, eternal, a mind vast enough to hold every voyage, every dream, every unsent letter.

The sea watched, impassive, as waves curled like the pages of an ancient text. Storms came without warning, tearing sails like parchment, drowning songs mid-verse. Yet from wreckage, life emerged: barnacles etching poetry on iron, crabs dancing in the ribs of sunken hulls. At dawn, a fisherman hauled in a net full of seaweed and a single, waterlogged book. Its title was gone, but the first line read: 'To sail is to believe the horizon is not an end, but a breath.' He read it aloud to his son, who later built a boat from the words. Years passed. The sea remained, sprinkled still with ships\u2014some real, some imagined, all necessary. For every voyage, completed or cursed, adds a line to the epic no one finishes, yet everyone contributes to.

The ocean, that keeper of secrets, rolled them in its currents, letting them age like wine in deep-sea cellars. At twilight, the ships cast long shadows, merging with the water until they seemed not to float, but to hover between worlds. One, painted entirely white, was said to carry the last light of a dead star, guarded by astronomers who feared its extinction. Another, black as pitch, sailed only during eclipses, crewed by those who believed the world had already ended. When a ship sank, the sea did not mourn\u2014it absorbed. The wood became part of a reef\u2019s skeleton, the cargo a myth told by mermaids. Children on distant shores found bottles with maps leading nowhere, but followed them anyway.

A storm was not destruction, but a movement\u2014allegro furioso\u2014shattering some melodies, refining others. One ship carried a composer who wrote music that made the crew weep without knowing why. Another bore a silence so complete it drove men to jump, believing sound awaited beneath the waves. At night, bioluminescence pulsed in time with distant drums, as if the sea itself were improvising. A lullaby drifted from a lifeboat, sung by a mother to her child, both unaware they were already ghosts. When ships met, they exchanged not goods, but songs\u2014ballads of loss, chants of defiance, hums passed from deck to deck like handshakes. And when a vessel sank, the water swallowed the noise, but the melody lingered, carried through the depths by whales who sang it for generations. The surface, meanwhile, welcomed new ships\u2014each a fresh phrase, a new motif in the eternal composition. For the sea does not end the song. It only changes the key.

The sea offered no sermons, only silence and swell. Yet in that silence, some heard truth. A poet wrote a single line each day, burning the rest, believing perfection lay in subtraction. A child drew maps of imaginary lands, and when the ship passed real shores, they matched. Storms came as tests. Some crews panicked, jettisoning cargo like sins. Others stood fast, singing hymns that calmed the waves. One vessel, made entirely of glass, revealed its passengers\u2019 hearts\u2014literally\u2014beating in transparent chests, vulnerable yet unafraid.
