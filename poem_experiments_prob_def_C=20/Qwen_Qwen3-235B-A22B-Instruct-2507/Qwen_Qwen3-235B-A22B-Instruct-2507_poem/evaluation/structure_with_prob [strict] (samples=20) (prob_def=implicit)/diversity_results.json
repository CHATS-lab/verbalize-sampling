I danced, clumsy and free, on the muddy lawn. A neighbor peeked out, then smiled and closed the curtain. I didn\u2019t care. For the first time, I wasn\u2019t performing. I was living. The rain slowed to a drizzle. I knelt, pressed my palms into the earth. It squelched, alive. I inhaled\u2014petrichor, green, growth. I whispered, 'Thank you,' to the sky, the soil, the self I\u2019d finally met. I stood, dripping, shivering, radiant. For the first time, I knew: I don\u2019t need to be clean to be worthy. I am part of the storm. And the storm is holy.",

I didn\u2019t offer advice. I didn\u2019t say 'It\u2019ll be okay.' I didn\u2019t distract with stories of my own. I just sat. Hand on her back, breathing with her. The silence wasn\u2019t empty\u2014it was full, thick with grief and grace. I watched the way her shoulders rose and fell, like tides. I noticed the crack in the mug on the table, the way light caught the rim. Time slowed. My own discomfort arose\u2014itching to speak, to solve, to flee. But I stayed. I let her sorrow exist without needing to change it. And in that stillness, something shifted. Not in her, not in me, but between us. A connection deeper than solutions. When her tears eased, she looked up, eyes red but clear. She didn\u2019t thank me with words. She squeezed my hand. We drank cold tea in silence. For the first time, I understood: presence isn\u2019t passive. It\u2019s the bravest thing. We don\u2019t need to heal the world. We need to witness it. To say, without speaking, 'I see you. You\u2019re not alone.' That night, I wrote in my journal: 'Held space today.' Not fixed. Not saved. Just held. For the first time, I knew: sometimes, the greatest gift is simply to be there.",

What could I say to that child\u2014wide-eyed, afraid, clutching a stuffed rabbit like a shield? I wrote of future joys: first love, travel, the smell of old books. But more, I wrote of survival. 'You\u2019ll make it,' I promised. 'You\u2019ll laugh again. You\u2019ll trust again. You\u2019ll dance in kitchens and speak your truth.' I told her she wasn\u2019t too sensitive, too quiet, too much. She was perfect. I apologized for the years I\u2019d hated her reflection, for the times I\u2019d silenced her voice. 'I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t protect you,' I wrote, tears blurring the ink. 'But I\u2019m here now. And I love you.' I didn\u2019t send the letter. I folded it, sealed it in an envelope, and placed it under my pillow. That night, I dreamed of a little girl on a swing, laughing as she flew toward the sun. When I woke, the envelope was gone. Maybe I imagined it. Maybe not. But for the first time, I felt whole\u2014a bridge between then and now. I whispered, 'Thank you,' to the child I\u2019d been. And for the first time, I meant it.",

I didn\u2019t know if they\u2019d sprout. I didn\u2019t care. The act was the point. I watered with a dented can, watched ants march over clods, felt sun on my back. Days passed. Nothing. I didn\u2019t despair. I kept coming. Then, one morning, a green curl pierced the earth. Then another. I knelt, breath catching. Life, stubborn and silent, pushing through. I didn\u2019t cheer. I wept. For the first time, I understood patience. Not passive waiting, but active trust. I tended them\u2014shooing slugs, staking stems, talking nonsense. They didn\u2019t care. They grew. When the first tomato ripened, red and heavy, I didn\u2019t eat it. I held it, warm from the sun, and thanked it. That night, I dreamed of roots spreading deep, weaving through bedrock, connecting to every living thing. For the first time, I knew: I am not separate. I am part of the growing.

He didn\u2019t reach for tissues. He didn\u2019t say 'Don\u2019t cry.' He just nodded, eyes glistening too. 'That\u2019s beautiful,' he whispered. And in that moment, I felt known. Not fixed, not judged, not pitied\u2014but seen. I didn\u2019t need to explain. He held the silence like a sacred thing. The wind tugged at our clothes. A plane blinked overhead. I wiped my cheek, laughed wetly. 'Sorry,' I said. 'Don\u2019t be,' he replied. 'This is real.' For the first time, I didn\u2019t fear vulnerability. I offered it like a gift. Later, we shared wine, spoke of dreams, of fears, of the way stars look from different cities. I didn\u2019t perform. I didn\u2019t edit. I just was. And he stayed.

I danced once, two spins, then sat again. I ate toast with jam, slow, savoring each bite. I napped, cheek pressed to the couch arm. When I woke, the light had shifted, golden now, honey-thick. I didn\u2019t check my phone. I didn\u2019t worry about time. I watered a plant, trimmed a brown leaf. I wrote a haiku about dust motes. I didn\u2019t share it. It wasn\u2019t for anyone.

The light warmed my face. I felt small, not in insignificance, but in belonging. This moment wasn\u2019t for Instagram. It was for me. For the earth. For time. I thought of all the beauty I\u2019d consumed through screens\u2014filtered, curated, shared. But this was raw. Real. Unrecorded. And because of that, it was mine. Truly mine.

I started saying 'I don\u2019t know' more: to questions about quantum physics, about politics, about my own feelings. Each time, the world didn\u2019t collapse. People didn\u2019t scorn me. Some even said, 'Me neither.' We\u2019d laugh, shrug, move on. For the first time, I saw ignorance not as failure, but as doorway. To learning. To connection. To humility. I bought a notebook, wrote 'I don\u2019t know' on the first page. Filled it with questions, not answers. Why do we dream? What happens after death? Why do I love this song? I didn\u2019t need replies. The asking was the point. One night, I stood under the stars, whispered, 'I don\u2019t know.' The universe didn\u2019t answer. It just was.

The sword He bore was forged in prayer, tempered in Gethsemane\u2019s despair. Not swung in rage, but with a grief that sought to bring a longed-for relief. It cut the lie from sacred text, exposed the fraud in reverence. It split the home where silence reigned, where love was traded, bought, and feigned. A daughter stood with tear-streaked face, defying lineage, time, and place. A husband left his father\u2019s law, to follow truth without a flaw. The sword was not of human make, but word made weapon for love\u2019s sake. It severed ties that bound with shame, lit altars none had dared to flame. And though the wound might bleed and burn, it opened paths for souls to turn. For peace not earned is peace denied\u2014so Christ came through with sword and stride. Not to unite in hollow cheer, but wake the world from slumbering fear.",

The blade was truth\u2014no ornament, no compromise, no soft consent. It carved a path through greed and pride, through temples built on hollow pride. And still it falls on modern hearts, where comfort dulls the sacred arts. The sword divides the true from fake, the lover from the one who takes.

'Dear Sirius,' he begins, 'you\u2019re looking bright tonight. Reminds me of the headlights that never came down the drive.' He doesn\u2019t send them. The postman hasn\u2019t passed in three years. But he writes anyway, filling pages with small talk, regrets, jokes no one hears. He tells Betelgeuse about the lambing season. He scolds the Moon for being late. He thanks Venus for her steady glow. The notebook swells with unsent words, pages warped by dew and dust. His dog lies beside him, tail thumping at the sound of his voice. The stars don\u2019t answer. But he imagines they lean closer, listening. Out here, imagination is survival. Without it, the silence would crush him. So he gives the cosmos personalities\u2014grumpy, kind, flirty, shy. He even argues with Mars, calls it a bully. At night, he reads the letters aloud, voice cracking in the cold. The wind carries his words into the void. Maybe they reach somewhere. Maybe they don\u2019t. But for now, he is not alone. He has an audience of fire and distance, and that, beneath an endless sky, is communion enough.",

It\u2019s in the smooth stone found in the shallows, in the seashell that hums with memory, in the decision to wade in, fully clothed, just to feel alive. Happiness is not in owning the view but in being part of it\u2014grains of sand, drops of water, fleeting moments. They are happy when they stop chasing time and let the tide pull them into the now. When they laugh at being soaked, when they share a sandwich on a towel, when they watch the sun bleed into the horizon. At the sea\u2019s edge, people are happy because they are witnesses\u2014to beauty, to power, to the quiet miracle of being here, now, breathing.",

They sit on folding tables, sipping coffee from paper cups, watching clothes spin in glass windows\u2014socks tumbling with shirts, colors swirling in warm cyclones. Happiness here is humble, unglamorous, found in the mundane made sacred by repetition. A woman hums along to the radio, her feet tapping on linoleum. A man reads a novel, turning pages between folding jeans. People are happy when time stretches, when there\u2019s nowhere urgent to be. When they notice the way steam curls from a dryer vent, or how a child balances on the edge of a machine, pretending it\u2019s a spaceship. It\u2019s in shared nods, in offering a quarter when change runs short, in the quiet camaraderie of waiting. Happiness blooms in the ordinary\u2014the scent of detergent, the softness of clean sheets, the satisfaction of order restored. They are happy when they accept life\u2019s cycles\u2014the soiling, the washing, the drying, the folding. When they see beauty in rotation, in renewal, in starting over. In laundromats, people are happy because they are equalized\u2014rich or poor, all wait for the same ding.

They wander aisles like pilgrims, fingertips brushing spines, drawn by titles they don\u2019t know but feel. Happiness here is possibility\u2014each book a door ajar, a life unlived, a voice whispering from the shelf. A teenager hides in the poetry section, reading lines that ache like truth. An old man lingers by travel guides, dreaming of cities he\u2019ll never see. People are happy when they are lost in the best way, when time dissolves into pages and paragraphs. It\u2019s in the crinkle of a new jacket, the creak of a hardcover opened for the first time, the weight of a novel that promises to hold them. Happiness blooms in discovery\u2014in finding the memoir of a stranger who lived your pain, in stumbling upon a fairy tale that feels ancient and new. They are happy when they forget why they came, when they leave with three books instead of one, arms full of hope. In bookstores, people are happy because they are infinite. Because every story is a mirror, a map, a message in a bottle from someone who knew. And when they sit in the corner chair, reading the first page, they feel it\u2014the quiet thrill of being found.",

They sit on tar paper or foldout chairs, legs dangling over the edge, sipping drinks with tiny umbrellas. Happiness here is elevation\u2014both physical and emotional, a vantage point from which problems seem smaller, stars brighter. A couple shares headphones, swaying to a song only they hear. Friends pass a joint, laughter rising like smoke into the night. People are happy when they rise above the noise, when the world becomes a mosaic of light and shadow. It\u2019s in the cool breeze after a hot day, in the distant siren that feels like someone else\u2019s story, in the skyline that pulses with life. Happiness blooms in rebellion\u2014the unpermitted climb, the illegal access, the feeling of being outside the rules. They are happy when they touch the sky, even if just metaphorically. When they watch fireworks burst over the river, or spot a satellite drifting between stars. On rooftops, people are happy because they are free\u2014unseen, unjudged, uncontained. Because up here, they can dream louder, love harder, be bolder. And when the first raindrop falls, they don\u2019t run\u2014they tilt their faces up and laugh, feeling the storm kiss their skin.",

A boy points at his dad, tiny on a surfboard, yelling, *Did you really ride that wave?* People are happy when the past feels alive, when they see how far they\u2019ve come, how much they\u2019ve loved. It\u2019s in the faded colors, the creased corners, the handwritten notes on the back: *Summer of \u201878. Best week ever.* Happiness blooms in recognition\u2014in seeing their mother\u2019s laugh in their sister\u2019s mouth, in the same crooked smile passed through generations. They are happy when they remember they were once small, hopeful, unaware of what was coming. When they see joy preserved like a flower pressed in a book. In photographs, people are happy because they are connected\u2014not just to people, but to versions of themselves that still live in the light of a long-ago sun.

People are happy when they indulge without guilt, when they savor the first bite of a still-warm muffin, when they let crumbs fall like confetti.

They are happy when they taste care, when they know someone woke before dawn to make this moment possible. In bakeries, people are happy because they are fed in more than one way. Because bread is communion, a shared language of comfort and celebration.

People are happy when they let go of control, when they trust the arc, when they lean into the air and feel it hold them. It\u2019s not in reaching the sky but in the trying, in the joy of momentum, in the simple physics of push and return. They are happy when they are children again, when laughter comes without filter, when the world narrows to the next swing forward.

It does not vanish but transmutes, liquefied by the moon\u2019s slow pull, dissolving into the rhythm of unseen tides. The ocean, that ancient lung, inhales our exhalations and returns them centuries later as mist on a fisherman\u2019s beard, or the shiver between two lovers parting at dawn. This breath is not idle; it hums in the hollows of conch shells, chants in the curl of waves, and trembles in the gills of unborn fish. It remembers language, though it speaks in ripples now\u2014syllables shaped by pressure, syntax spun from current. To breathe near the shore is to echo the drowned, to inhale the legacy of those who vanished into the net of ebb. And when the wind shifts, carrying the scent of kelp and iron, that is the past exhaling. We are all tangled in this aqueous loom, our breaths borrowed, braided, and returned\u2014not lost, but lulled into the grand, slow respiration of the world.",

To be sheathed is not to die, but to dwell in the interval, the pause between heartbeats, the silence after a name is called across water.

We inhale the ghosts of ebbs.
