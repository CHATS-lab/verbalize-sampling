My heart drummed a new language, one my body remembered before my mind could claim it. I laughed into the wind, and it carried my joy like a message in a bottle. Up there, above fences and fears, I felt weightless, not because I was free, but because I had finally stopped pretending gravity was the only truth.

Sunlight slants through dusty panes, illuminating motes that dance like ideas. Stalky, Conway, King\u2014three minds in silent congress\u2014need no words. A glance, a nod, a stifled grin: the pact is sealed. This is not mere mischief; it is orchestration. The prelude lives in the details: the misplaced key, the altered timetable, the innocent question that unravels a superior\u2019s composure. They do not seek destruction, but revelation\u2014the exposure of pomposity, the triumph of wit over wrath. The school believes it instills discipline, but the boys are learning something sharper: how to navigate power, how to weaponize laughter. Each prank is a lesson, each escape a victory. The prelude is not silence, but the gathering of storm clouds\u2014small, distant, inevitable. And when the first laugh erupts, sudden and bright, we understand: the overture was not leading to rebellion. It was rebellion itself, disguised as calm. These are not boys awaiting adulthood. They are already men of a different code\u2014one written in irony, sealed with a smirk, and lived in the electric space between rules and the will to bend them.",

Together, they are a tribunal of trouble, dispensing justice in the form of pranks. The school, with its rigid hierarchies and brittle authority, believes itself unassailable. But the boys see the cracks\u2014the vanity, the predictability, the fragile ego beneath the bluster. The prelude is their reconnaissance, their silent rehearsal.

The schoolyard lies quiet, dew-damp and expectant, like a stage before the actors enter. But the actors are already here: Stalky, Conway, King\u2014three boys who treat education not as submission, but as a game to be mastered. Their classroom is the corridor, their textbook the rulebook they rewrite in whispers. The prelude hums in the rustle of a hidden plan, in the way a dropped book becomes a diversion, in the pause before a response too innocent to be true. They do not rebel out of malice, but out of a deep, unspoken understanding that authority often mistakes rigidity for wisdom. So they test it. With pranks that are essays in logic, with escapes that are feats of timing, they expose the gaps between policy and power. The prelude is in the setup\u2014the forged letter, the misplaced evidence, the alibi airtight as a drum. It is not chaos, but choreography.
