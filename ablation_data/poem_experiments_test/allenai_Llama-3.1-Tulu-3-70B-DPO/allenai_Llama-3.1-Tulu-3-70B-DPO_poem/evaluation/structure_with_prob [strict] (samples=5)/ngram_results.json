With the rustle of leaves, as they fall to the ground like forgotten beliefs. Each leaf a memory, caught in the breeze, a life once vibrant, now just a tease. Express loss with the flow of a river's might, carving canyons of sorrow through the day and night. The water weeps, relentless in its course, a testament to the power of remorse. Gather stones from the brook, each smooth and cool, arrange them in patterns, a circle, a pool. A cairn, a marker of where loss lies, a testament to the journey, to the tears and the cries. Grieve with the fire, let it consume, let it transform, let it resume. From ashes, new growth, a cycle complete, in the art of expression, in the dance of defeat.",
