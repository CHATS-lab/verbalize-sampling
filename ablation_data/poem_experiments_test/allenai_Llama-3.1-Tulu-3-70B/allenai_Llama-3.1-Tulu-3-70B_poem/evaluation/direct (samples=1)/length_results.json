So let me listen, let me learn, let me grow,  In truth's enduring, unwavering grace,  For only then shall my words truly show  The power of truth, in every time and place.  ",

Insects hummed their drowsy tunes of old,  And in the shade, the world seemed young and bold.The river coiled like silver, smooth and slow,  Reflecting dreams that only daylight knows.  Fish darted beneath the surface, bright and quick,  Their scales like flecks of sunlight, wondrous trick.The meadow's children, daisies danced in rows,  With buttercups that nodded, all aglow.  The sky a canvas, brushed with softest blue,  Where cotton-castles drifted, dreams anew.A lark ascended, trilling high its song,  A melody that pierced the heart, so strong.  Each note a jewel, in the warm, still air,  A symphony of summer, beyond compare.And I, beneath the boughs of an ancient tree,  Felt time stand still, enveloped by the glee  Of noontide sun and nature's sweet embrace,  In moments fleeting, yet forever I'll trace.",

I rise, I soar, I learn to forgive,  To release the chains, to truly live.",

It's in the silent embrace of a friend,  Or the warm glow of a story's end.So people are happy, in their own ways,  Finding solace in sunsets and oceanic sprays.

The sun's embrace, the moon's soft glow,  In every moment's ebb and flow,  I find a peace, a quiet know,  That in this vastness, I am whole.  Before me stands I see,  A canvas vast for dreams to be,  In every color, in every hue,  I paint my life, my world, anew.  So here I stand, at the edge of time,  With courage, hope, and rhymes,  Embracing the unknown, hand in hand,  Before me stands I see, a promised land.  ",

Uncertain, like life's own course,But spirit unyielding, a strength without remorse.In Kabul's heart, the sun will rise again,To paint a new day, with hues of hope, and begin.",

The moon retires, a silver ghost,  Leaving the stage for you alone.Yet, even as you blaze the sky,  Your warmth, a gift, can't be denied.  Life blooms beneath your ardent glow,  A testament to your fiery show.So carry on, old blazing fool,  We'll bask in your warmth, play the rule.  But remember, as you set at last,  The night will softly hold us fast.",

Yet in the quiet moments, we find solace deep,  In love, laughter, and the warmth of the hearth's flame.",

To the beauty of the moment, fleeting,  To the window, a bridge, a meeting,  Of past and future, the eternal greeting.  This minute, a gift, a treasure,  Caught within the window's measure.  In silent reverence, I surrender.  ",

He painted in words the wild moor,  The heather, the thistle, the bracing wind's roar,  A land where kings and paupers were kin.

The tracks lay before it, a path of iron and steel,  Guiding it forward, a purpose that's real.Cities it passes, sleeping giants in their slumber,  Dreaming of morning, unaware of the train's number.  The countryside unfolds, a tapestry of night,  With fields and forests bathed in moon's soft light.Inside, passengers slumber, or gaze into the glass,  Reflecting on life's journeys, the stories that they pass.  Some are seeking fortune, others love's embrace,  All aboard this arrow, through time and space.And as it darts through tunnels, echoing its own sound,  The world outside is moving, though to the train unbound.  A journey through the dark, with destinations unknown,  Yet the arrow-train moves on, steadfast and alone.In the quiet carriage, dreams are woven and spun,  While the train, like an arrow, steadfastly shuns  The hesitation, the pause, the lingering doubt,  Pressing on through the night, without a single shout.Thus, it speeds onward, a spectral force, a dream,  Carving through the darkness, a relentless, silent stream.  Till dawn breaks, and the arrow-train slows its pace,  Leaving the night behind, in the light of day's warm embrace.",

Her thoughts, like fireflies, dart and flee,  In dreamscape's boundless, vast expanse.  A life unlived, a world untold,  In sleep's sweet promise, she unfolds.  The room, a sanctuary of peace,  Cricket's song, the midnight's lease.  She lies alone upon her bed,  In solitude, comfort is spread.  The night, her keeper, watches o'er,  As dreams weave tales, forevermore.  ",

Silent echoes of laughter once shared,  Now only shadows in your domain,  The ghostly whispers of love that dared,  To breach the parapets of your pain.  For every dalliance, a cautious retreat,  Each fragile trust carefully weighed,  Afraid to venture, to chance defeat,  In love's tumultuous, stormy glade.  Your eyes, pools of unspoken fears,  Guard secrets and dreams entwined,  A silent vigil through the years,  While the world outside turns, unkind.  But hear the song of the wind's gentle plea,  A melody seeking your embrace,  A promise of skies ever blue and free,  To guide your wary heart back to grace.  For love, though sometimes a fickle flame,  Can warm the coldest, loneliest night,  It asks not for perfection, but to tame  The fears that keep your spirit in flight.  O forlorn heart, so pure and unstained,  Let one brave beat chart a new course,  Embrace the risk, the unclaimed, the gained,  And soar on love's most delicate force.  ",

Harken to the call,The echoes of coins, like whispers, they fall.Each jingle, each clink, a secret revealed,Stories untold from the corners concealed.In rustling folds where lint gathers,Lies the dust of dreams, the fragments of laughter.A ticket stub, a faded receipt,A crumpled note, a heartfelt keep.Shake out my pockets! The treasures of yesterdays,The breadcrumbs of moments, the memories in disarray.A key with no lock, a button from a lost coat,A paperclip bent, a forgotten note.Harken to the call, the pockets' song,Each item a relic, each piece, uniquely strong.Pennies and dimes, the currency of life,Sift through the clutter, find the strife.In every crevice, a tale to unfold,A coin's edge worn smooth, stories untold.Shake out my pockets! Let the past resound,For in the chaos, truth is found.The lint of days, the crumbs of nights,In these pockets lie the echoes of lights.What falls to the ground may be lost in time,But the call of the pockets, a chime.So shake them out, pockets deep and wide,For in their depths, our essence abides.Hear the call, the jingle, the clatter,A melody of life, a purposeful matter.",
