This minute, I see my own face,\nReflected and ghost-like, in this silent space.\nA flicker of memory, a smile or a tear,\nEchoes of moments, held tenderly here.\n\nThat's my window. This minute, no longer a view,\nBut a mirror reflecting, what I'm going through.\nThe world outside waits, but for now, I'll just be,\nWith the person I am, staring back at me.\n\nThat's my window. This minute, a pause to reflect,\nOn the paths I have walked, and the dreams to expect.\nAnd though the scene changes, with each passing hour,\nThis window's my portal, my moment of power.",
