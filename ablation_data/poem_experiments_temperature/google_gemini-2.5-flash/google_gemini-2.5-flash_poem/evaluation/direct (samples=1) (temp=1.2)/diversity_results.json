I shall speak you if I am in habit of listening to you,For how can I voice what I've never truly heard?You are not a lightning bolt, a sudden, bright hue,But a quiet unfolding, a carefully chosen word.You whisper in the rustle of leaves, the morning's soft grey,In the distant hum of traffic, the dog's contented sigh.You're in the silence between breaths, the close of a day,A tapestry woven beneath a vast, indifferent sky.If I rush past the murmurs, the gentle, subtle clues,If my ears are blocked by ego, by the clamor of desire,Then what I speak will be but shadows, ill-fitting shoes,A hollow echo, a poorly tended fire.So let me first be still, a patient, open ear,To the tremor of conviction, the doubt's soft, questioning plea.To the brave admission, banishing all fear,And the gentle wisdom flowing, wild and free.Then, perhaps, when my soul has caught your steady tone,When my spirit aligns with your rhythmic, honest beat,I can offer you forth, not as a seed but fully grown,A testament to listening, sacred, complete.",

Yet, comfort's tendrils, silken, strong,Can bind the soul in a familiar song,Until the spirit, once a vibrant flame,Becomes a flicker, whispering a nameIt can't recall, a wildness lost to ease.The gentle rustle of a summer breezeIs not the gale that carves the mountain's face.Growth demands friction, an unquiet place.The soul, when stirred from slumber's hazy balm,Finds strength in tempest, not in endless calm.The ache of longing, the sharp sting of doubt,Are chisels shaping what we're truly about.To question roots, to brave the path unknown,To shed the skin that comfort long has grown,Is to reclaim the spark, the daring flight.For in the darkness, we ignite our light.So bless the tremors that unmoor the past,The restless yearning, built to truly lastBeyond the walls of what we thought was true.For hope, a wild bird, always springs anew,From ground disturbed, from skies that don't conform,A beacon burning brightly in the storm.",
