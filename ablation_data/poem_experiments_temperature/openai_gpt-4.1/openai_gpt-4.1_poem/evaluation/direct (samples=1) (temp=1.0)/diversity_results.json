I count them: fear of silence, fear of sound,  Of dreams that disappear when I awake,  Of love unspoken, anguish never found,  Of faith that shivers, afraid it might break.  Yet in this reckoning of dark and dread,  A small faint glimmer stirs inside my chest:  A moth that beats its wings beside my bed,  Intuiting that night brings restless rest.  So let me name these fears, one trembling bead  Upon a rosary I hold too tight;  And in the saying, let me sow a seed\u2014  A fragile hope that learns to bear the light.",

The laughter is sharp, though the silence is deep,  Where the wallabies graze and the ironbarks sleep.

On a lonely selection, far out in the West,  A heart builds its home in the blue-wrinkled crest\u2014  With rust, dust, and starlight to cradle its dream,  And solace threaded fine through each sun-mottled seam.",

Each heart carries stories, whispered on different winds,  In temples or under sun, where their quiet prayers begin.  I shake hands with a neighbor who bows east at dawn,  Who sings with a language new, but the ache is never gone  For the peace we seek together, in the hush after storm,  Our laughter blooming bright in every different form.  Their faith carved from childhood, their skin painting light,  Their customs unfolding like banners in flight.  To honor, not own, all the dreams that have been\u2014  To listen and marvel what grows from within.  We gather in circles, our palms pressed to earth,  The same sun on our faces, the same sky since birth.  And if love is a fire, let it burn down the walls,  Let it shape us as kin when the darkness befalls.  For the soul wears no colors, the soul holds no line;  It hungers for union, for kindness, for time.  So I stand here in reverence, as gentle hearts lead\u2014  I respect, another man\u2019s religion, or color or creed.",

No thunderstrike, no bitter shrill,  Just silence swelling in between  The action and the afterthought;  The page that tore and left a seam,  A yawn where meaning once was caught  Like sunlight stitched beside a dream.Now echoes wander where I stood.  Freedom and loss, their faces one,  Rush in\u2014roots cracked and splinters hewn\u2014  The sapling toppled by the sun.  To break is both the end and start,  A suture burst, a wound gone wide.  It snapped, and from the ruptured heart  The world spilled out from deep inside.",
