Lonely is the single lamplight flickering  Across empty pavement, drawing shadows  That never meet, never blend,  Only stretching, thin and silent,  Beneath the broken moon.  It is the echo of your laughter  In a room that remembers  No other voices,  The ache of a chair unsat upon,  A cup cooling where no lips will press.  Lonely is a star lost in daylight,  A melody hummed into the void,  A letter written, sealed, and never sent\u2014  It is the ache before sleep,  The reach across a bed of cold sheets,  The yearning in your bones for a touch  You cannot name.  Yet within lonely there is a quiet hope,  A seed curling in the dark,  Waiting for the warmth of another,  For the hush to break\u2014  For hands to find hands, and voices  To fill the room at last.",

Yet\u2014  In the marrow of the silence,  A seed curls tight, waiting for rain.  Lonely is the space where longing grows,  The tender hollow that shapes a wish\u2014  A cradle for hope,  A pause before the heart calls out  And finds, somewhere,  An answering note.",

Yet in each sorry telling, in every whispered spell,  We find ourselves the orchard, and our hearts the fruit that fell.",

A kettle still hangs on a soot-blackened hook,  And the wind tells of laughter and loss;  Of children who grew by the heat of the cook,  Of seasons that hardened like dross.  Yet each dusk, as the pink floods the saltbush and stone,  And the world wears its loneliness best,  A single crow carves out a path of its own,  On a lonely selection far out in the West.  Here, hope is a whisper that rides on the breeze,  And memory\u2019s a ghost in the grass\u2014  But the stars keep their vigil with effortless ease,  As the silent, wide centuries pass.",

Billboards of longing, half-lit in the rain,  Promise tomorrow, but offer the same.The shoulders are littered with dreams cast aside,  Crumpled and silent, with nowhere to hide.  Beneath the cold glare of indifferent stars,  The pavement remembers our battles and scars.Taillights like embers drift into the night,  Chasing horizons that flicker from sight.  At the highways of woes, we are wanderers all\u2014  Bound by the urge to outrun what befalls.Yet sometimes a stranger, with kindness to spare,  Will offer a smile, a song, or a prayer.  And dawn, on the shoulder, will quietly rise,  Painting new colors on sorrow\u2019s disguise.So drive through the shadows, and follow the line\u2014  Even the highways of woes end in light, given time.",

Here, sorrow is mapped in invisible lanes\u2014  Each car a confession, a pause, or a plea,  Wipers drag tears on the windshield of pain,  And the road stretches onward, unwilling, unfree.  Billboards of memory flash overhead,  Lit with regrets that refuse to decay;  The mile markers count every word left unsaid,  Refusing to shrink or to fade away.  There\u2019s a chorus of horns, a dirge of lost time,  As headlights dissolve in the rearview of dawn;  Yet hope, like a stowaway, hums a soft rhyme\u2014  A promise that sorrow will someday be gone.  At the highways of woes, we drive and endure,  Merging our longing in rivers of tar.  We chase after solace, uncertain but sure,  Believing redemption may not be that far.",

Creed is a compass, a drum in your chest,  Guiding your footsteps on quests for the best.  Your truth may not mirror the truth that I know,  Yet rivers converge as they flow, as they flow.  So sit here beside me\u2014no borders, no bars,  We\u2019ll speak in the language of wounds and of stars.

Home\u2014where shoes are lined in rows,  Keys rattle, echo in the hall,  Dinner sizzles, TV glows,  Children\u2019s laughter, footsteps small.  We eat, we talk, we fold the day  Into a drawer, neat and deep,  And as the darkness softly comes,  We sigh, surrender, fall to sleep.  Yet in this cycle, dull and worn,  A spark survives the endless loop:  A glance, a joke, a dream reborn,  A whispered hope that dares to swoop\u2014  That life is more than lines we trace  In dust, in time, with hearts that leap.  Wake, work, home, eat, sleep, embrace\u2014  And in the silence, secrets keep.",

Yet in her solitude she finds  A garden blooming in her mind,  Where sorrow\u2019s petals, dew-impearled,  Unfurl their hope against the world.",

It is the gentle ritual of remembering:  A candle lit, a letter written,  The steady, simple presence of tears  Falling like rain on the dry garden of your heart.  How do you grieve?  By loving what is gone, and letting the ache  Be a bridge\u2014raw, unfinished\u2014  To all you still hold, trembling, in the light.",

The sky is inked with satellites,  The stars now plotted, numbered, named;  Yet mystery, like ancient light,  Still waits, unclaimed, still burns, untamed.  Oh, let a child look up tonight,  And wonder why the moon is pale,  Or ask if angels ride the winds  Or if the rain remembers hail.  For as less on earth seek truth above,  The world grows heavy, hard, and small\u2014  But hearts that hunger for the sky  Might someday teach us to recall,  That truth is not a thing to own,  But something found, together, grown.",

I traced its silver tendon through the wild and tangled land,  Past willows bent in longing, through silt and shifting sand.  My feet grew raw with worry where the rapids split and churned,  I watched the sky\u2019s reflection and the seasons as they turned.  There were nights the stars were blinded by the fog\u2019s unyielding shroud,  And days when thunder\u2019s laughter left my spirit bowed.  But always, always water\u2014singing secrets in the stone,  Promising a sanctuary I had never known.  The banks grew lush with memory, the air grew thick with song,  And every step, though faltering, felt right, though sometimes wrong.  At last, a bend revealing you: the calm at journey\u2019s end,  Your eyes, a quiet harbor where broken hearts can mend.  The river, ever faithful, had carried me to light\u2014  We stood together, trembling, beneath the stars of night.  For all the winding miles and the trials I came through,  The river, long and lonely, was only ever leading to you.",
