It is the stone, not the tide,  the root, not the falling leaf.  And though it hides, it will not hide  the quiet work of private grief.  So let it burn, but not consume\u2014  let it forge, not only flame.  For from such heat, a soul may bloom,  and whisper, changed, a different name.",

Not conquest in their voices, nor hunger for the crown,  But triumph in the gathering, where all the lost are found.  The banners dip and dance as doves take startled flight,  Painting shadows on the pavement, turning day to light.

So let the jesters dance in flame,  Let cannons boom their punchlines loud\u2014  But when the curtain falls at last,  We\u2019ll write our names in quiet, proud,  And teach the world the punchline\u2019s cost:  A child who dreams of peace, not dust,  And knows the joke was never just.",

War\u2019s a joke\u2014its irony, vast and cruel,  Is that we\u2019re all both audience and fool.  We laugh until our voices crack,  Then whisper, *When do we come back?*  But no one answers. Just the wind,  And silence stitched where wars begin.  And still we grin,  Because to frown\u2014  Would be to lose the game.",

Now roots crack pavement, branches bow, as if in quiet grief\u2014  The earth remembers what the heart refuses to believe.Lonely is the song half-sung, the letter never sent,  The shadow stretching long behind when daylight\u2019s almost spent.

Lonely is not just the lack of footsteps in the hall,  But the hollow in the chest when no one catches your fall.  It\u2019s the secondhand love in hurried goodbyes,  The tremor in a hand that no one reaches to tie.  It\u2019s stars too bright in a sky too wide,  A song half-sung, a door left wide,  A photograph where one face fades,  And time erodes the promises made.  But in the hush, a pulse remains\u2014  A heart that beats through storm and chains.  For lonely is not the end, but a space, a breath,  A quiet womb before the birth of depth.  And in its grasp, though dark and deep,  The soul learns how to sing, and how to keep  A vigil not for loss, but for the light  That one day stirs\u2014against the night.",

The peace He left was not the hush that follows the accord,  But peace through fire, peace through loss\u2014the sword, the cross, the Lord.

He did not come to settle scores with trumpets or with flame,  But to carve His name in marrow, to rekindle every name  That cowered in the shadows where the wolves of empire fed\u2014  And raise a blade of mercy where the soul lay cold and dead.  So peace? Not as the world gives. Not as silence after war.  But peace born from the breaking, peace that scars\u2014and loves the more.  For the sword He brought was mercy, honed on Golgotha\u2019s ridge\u2014  To slay the false, restore the lost, and wound the world to bridge.",

So the selection breathes, though it stands alone,  A testament carved by the wind and the sun\u2014  Not conquered, not broken, but deeply, quietly known,  By the few who remain when the dream is done.",

No footfall disturbs the red dust at the door,  No child\u2019s laugh rings out on the heat-hazed air,  Just the creak of the hinges, the old dog\u2019s snore,  And the ghost of a name whispered nowhere.  Once, boots by the hearth were worn thin at the toe,  And a woman with eyes like the dawn used to wait,  Mending shirts with a thread of love sewn below,  Counting days on a Bible worn at the gate.  But the gold in the creek ran as dry as the clay,  And the man chased a rumour where river meets sky.  Now the kookaburra laughs at the end of the day,  And the stars blink cold in a vast, watching eye.  The wind still hums a lullaby old,  Of dreams sown deep in an unforgiving land\u2014  Of love that was fierce, though the story\u2019s untold,  Of a heart that once beat at the edge of the sand.  On that lonely selection, the silence remains,  A breath in the wattle, a sigh in the grass\u2014  The West keeps its secrets, its joys and its pains,  And the past never dies. It just fades into dusk, and into glass.",

No need to hold the joy too tightly\u2014  it lives not in grasp, but in how I give.  For when I am happy, the universe breathes  and learns, for a moment, how to live.",

They lower you to soil and sleep,  where roots will cradle secrets deep.  No dawn will break to steal this rite\u2014  the night has claimed you, deep and bright.  And in the hush, your name takes flight,  a whisper through the vault of night.  No sun to blind, no false pretense\u2014  just truth in dark, and love immense.  The funeral ends, the people creep  like embers fading into sleep.  But here, beneath the endless blue,  the night keeps watch. It honors you.",

You\u2019ve warmed the world since time began,  Roused schoolboys, sour apprentices,  But we, who dwell within love\u2019s span,  Are ruled by subtler mysteries.  She is both morning and high noon,  Her breath outshines your fiercest ray.  If she should frown, your light would swoon\u2014  You\u2019d fade before her slightest sigh.  Go, tell late courtiers to attend  On foolish kings; go chase the herds  To fields where labor has no end\u2014  But leave us wrapped in whispered words.  You, who think your duty\u2019s done  By marking hours with stern parade,  Know this: when two hearts beat as one,  They make their own eternal shade.  Shine here, and you are everywhere\u2014  We\u2019ll burn brighter than your fire.  Love needs no watch, no calendar.  Go chide the seasons. We retire.",

But in the sunlit shallows, life still thrives\u2014  bright fish in schools, the root of water lilies,  the moon that pulls the tide though not the deep.  And if she\u2019s programmed, who is not?  By mother\u2019s voice, by schoolbell, street, and screen\u2014  we all are written, rewritten every day.

Yet in his theft, a kindness I discern:  He leaves behind the wisdom youth forgot,  The quiet grace of embers as they burn,  The love that time cannot untie or rot.  Though hairs turn silver with his whispered tread,  And steps grow slow on paths once swiftly led,  He does not steal the songs we sang at dawn,  Nor hands once held beneath a garden\u2019s arch.  The heart\u2019s deep pulse still beats its ancient song\u2014  A rhythm older than the stars\u2019 long march.  So let him take the shell, the face, the frame;  The soul outdances even Time\u2019s sly game.",

Yet in this transit of heartbreak and fear,  A seed of resilience begins to appear.  For even in sorrow, where pain freely flows,  The soul learns the rhythm the highway best knows:  To move, to endure, to carry the load,  To seek, through the darkness, a glimmer, a road  That climbs from the valley, that breaks from the night\u2014  A dawn built of courage, not free of the fight.  So I march on, though the highway still grieves,  For every wound carries the song that it weaves\u2014  And even the woeful can find, if they go,  The light at the end of the highways of woe.",

When shadows stretch and hope grows thin, and every path seems barred,  He lifts a lamp of ancient light \u2014 the word that never marred.  Through desert nights and valleys deep, where sorrow digs its well,  His mercy flows like hidden springs no drought can ever quell.  The saints may stumble, hearts may break, and tears like rivers fall,  But grace descends in silent dawns to cover over all.  For every wound, a salve unseen; for every cry, a song \u2014  The refuge holds what time would steal, and makes the broken strong.  So let the world grow cold and loud, and faith seem faint and far,  The saints still rest where light was born \u2014 beneath the morning star.  For God is more than fortress, more than shelter from the rain \u2014  He is the heart that beats within, and breath, and blood, and flame.",

The night now hums a lullaby,  Where silver blades against the sky  Bow low, as if to say, \u201cWe know\u2014  The quiet is where wonder grows.\u201d",

No silken words adorned their speech,  Just blunt truth on a weathered beach\u2014  Yet in their eyes, a poet\u2019s flame,  A love too fierce to speak its name.  They kissed the earth with boot and brow,  And cursed the sky, yet pledged their vow  To kin, to soil, to fleeting breath,  In quiet acts that conquered death.  For though they seemed with fate at war,  They cradled dreams behind the door\u2014  A lullaby in a miner\u2019s hum,  A rose grown fierce where ash had come.  He spoke of Burns, and I could see  The poet birthed from tyranny,  Who saw the soul in every scar  And sang the rough like they were star.  Not polished, no\u2014but true and deep,  Like rivers old that never sleep.  And in their grime, a hymn began:  The rough, the rude\u2014the hearts of man.",

They cursed the stars, yet kissed the ground,  In whisky dreams and sorrow drowned;  They fought with ploughs, with fists, with words,  And carved their names on ravening herds.  No velvet tongue, no courtly grace\u2014  Just truth that time cannot erase.  A farmer\u2019s laugh, a rebel\u2019s cry,  The flash of dawn in dour grey sky.

So when he spoke, the rafters wept,  And shadows danced where silence slept.  These men, though rough, with voices cracked,  Held Scotland whole upon their back.

They tilled the soil with stubborn pride,  Where stony roots and sorrows bide,  Their laughter cracked like winter's freeze,  But warmed the hearth on bitter eves.  They cursed the sky, the auld kirk, the plough,  Yet kissed the earth with furrowed brow.  No gilded tales their tales unfurled\u2014  Just truth stitched raw into the world.  He said such men, though coarse and plain,  Could make the stars feel kin to rain.  For in their chests, beneath the grime,  Beat poems born of thistle and time.  Like Burns, they sang in jagged tones  Of love, of loss, of broken stones,  Yet in each verse, a torch was lit\u2014  A fire no wind could ever quench.  And as he spoke, the room grew still,  The air hung thick with northern will.  Not polished men, nor softly bred\u2014  But souls that knew both bread and dread.  So here\u2019s to those the world calls rough,  Whose love is loud, whose silence, gruff.  For in their veins, the old blood runs\u2014  The poet\u2019s fire, the farmer\u2019s guns.",

They cursed the crown, yet kissed the loam,  Defied the lords but loved the lark,  Found grace in whisky, grief, and home,  And lit their dark with stubborn spark.  No saints, he said, but still they burned\u2014  Not bright, but fiercely, low and long,  Like embers where the moorland turned,  A flame too wild to be all wrong.  They stumbled drunk through heather rows,  Recited verses cracked with time,  Their eyes still held the ancient throes  Of Jacobite snow and border rhyme.  And though the world called them uncouth,  He saw in them a sacred fire\u2014  The kind that speaks against the truth  Not with a sword, but with a lyre.  So let the polished silence break  Before such rough and ready song.  For even in the harshest ache,  There beats a verse where we belong.

Not gentle men, nor soft of speech,  But fierce in love, in anger, each  A tempest wrapped in human skin,  Who let the truth burn fierce within.

So no\u2014I shall not waste, nor fade,  Nor let the silence be my blade.  I\u2019ll meet the void with open hand,  And shape from loss a shifting land\u2014  Where every tear, each silent prayer,  Becomes a seed, not waste, but air.  And in that breath, a world appears:  Not free from pain, but rich with years.",

No trophy sought in velvet halls or gilded frames,  But living phrases, wild and warm, beneath the moon\u2019s cold gaze\u2014  A metaphor that leaps across the flickering flames,  Or adjectives that shimmer through the mist in hidden ways.  I set my snares with patience, woven lines of rhyme,  Lured by the call of rhythms pulsing deep in ancient stone.  I followed trails of alliteration, meter\u2019s sacred chime,  Until the perfect line stood trembling\u2014mine, and mine alone.  No beast of fur or fang could match the thrill I knew  When \u201ceuphony\u201d darted through the glade on velvet sound,  Or \u201cluminous\u201d pooled in clearings where the light broke through,  And \u201cresilient\u201d echoed, a drumbeat from the ground.  I wounded some with overreach, let others flee uncaught,  Yet every loss refined the hunt, each failure taught me grace.  For poetry is not stolen\u2014it is earned, and dearly bought  In the quiet aftermath of meaning, face to face.  Now I rest, not empty-handed, but with treasures few and true:  Words of skill, not killed, but kindled\u2014alive, and burning bright\u2014  Etched in fire upon my tongue, and forever singing through  The wild, uncharted forests of my soul\u2019s long night.",

Her child, a breath on fragile ribs,  Sucks air like milk from empty stone,  Yet in the dimming of her eyes,  A fire refuses to be blown.  We are the seeds the wind forgot,  Tossed in the ash of broken years,  Yet sprout where no one dares to hope\u2014  Through cracked ground, through silent tears.  Born in the famine, yes\u2014but not  Of hunger alone are we made.  We are the dream the night denied,  The hymn the desert tried to shade.

Born in the famine\u2014true\u2014but also  In the laughter after rain,  In the hands that plant in barren soil  And sing the green to life again.  Africa, not just of lack and loss,  But of becoming, fierce and vast\u2014  A people forged in fire and dust,  And still, still rising from the past.",

We walk where shadows stretch long across the plain,  Carrying water, carrying grief, carrying grace.  Each footstep a prayer, each breath a rebellion  Against silence, against erasure, against faceless space.  Born in the famine, but not born to starve.  Our laughter rises like monsoon from the ground.  We paint with colors stolen from dawn,  And turn the ache into a song without sound.  Now we cross oceans, bearing scars like stars,  Guiding others through nights we already knew.  Africa lives in the curve of our palms,  In the seeds we plant wherever we brew.  Not just survival\u2014we are the rain coming.  The green after fire. The yes after no.  Born in the famine, but fed by tomorrow.",

I walked where vultures circled slow, where time moved like a sigh,  Yet in my chest, a drum still beat: *I am, I am, I am alive.*  And though the land was lean with loss, and grief wore many names,  I carried rivers in my blood, I whispered different flames.

O trembling bloom, so fiercely shy,  The world still turns with gentle grace.  Not every hand will wave goodbye,  Not every heart will leave a trace.  Unfurl, just once, your guarded chest\u2014  Let one true word dissolve the fear.  For even wounds may find their rest,  And forlorn hearts, at last, draw near.",

You\u2019ve watched the world in fervor burn,  Seen promises like petals fall,  Heard lovers\u2019 oaths at midnight turn  To silence, shadows, and the pall  Of dreams dissolved in bitter dust.  So you retreat behind your wall,  A fortress built of fragile trust,  Where moonlight speaks, and none can call  Without your guarded gates adjust.  You ache to yield, yet fear the cost\u2014  To be adored, then half-remembered,  A treasure found, too quickly lost.  But hark\u2014the wind through branches weeps,  It bears a tune both old and true:  No soul that loves is doomed to sleep  Forever in regret\u2019s cold dew.  The bravest act is not to flee,  But stand bare-chested in the flame.  O heart, though wary, let it be\u2014  Not flaw, but grace, your sacred name.  For love ungiven leaves a stain  Deeper than any wound or blame.  Unclench. Unfold. Let fall the chain.  Risk joy. Let wonder be your guide.  Even the stars must dare to shine  Before they\u2019re seen across the sky.",

O, light that needs no named source,  That rises not, but simply *is*,  You teach the heart a truer course:  That hope may bloom where hope seems lost.  Not every dark must yield to day,  Nor every wound await the dawn;  Sometimes, the night gives birth to rays  That from the soul\u2019s deep core are drawn.  So when the world says *there is none*,  When stars retreat and skies are sealed,  Recall the light where no sun shone\u2014  And how, in darkness, we are healed.",

The call is not for riches cleanly swept,  But all the lost, the broken, and the bright.  So let them fall, these relics of the road\u2014  Each one a compass pointing toward the soul.  Harken, now, to what the echoes hold:  Not destination, but the spirit\u2019s toll.  The pockets empty, yet the heart runs deep\u2014  A beggar\u2019s trove where wonders never sleep.",

So call her not by dress or name,  But by the light no dark can tame\u2014  For Cinderella, you must see,  Is not a tale. She is *who we are meant to be*.",

She is the sweep of brooms at break of day,  The ember glow in eyes that know delay.  Not born of palace halls or golden thread,  But forged in silence, hunger, tears once shed.  She is the grace that bends but will not break,  The dignity a heart can hold and make  From scraps of kindness, dreams worn thin and bare,  A soul that sings without a song to spare.  Cinderella means the pulse beneath the skin,  The light that gathers where the world\u2019s been dim.  Not just the beauty caught in glass at dawn,  But how she carried hope when all was gone.  She is the curve of kindness in a glance,  The courage found in giving second chance.  Not made by fairies, nor by magic\u2019s call\u2014  But by the choice to rise, to stand, to be at all.  So when you speak her name, don\u2019t think of gold,  But of the fire that every soul can hold.  For Cinderella means, in truth, in grace\u2014  The quiet brilliance of a human face.",

She is the spark in a cracked hearth\u2019s core,  The strength that needs no fanfare or door.  A glance that forgives, a step that stays,  The courage to meet the judging days.  Cinderella is kindness worn thin,  Yet never broken from deep within.  She is the bloom in a barren place,  The smile that honors the soul\u2019s long race.

Not merely the curve of a cheek,  But the strength in the silence when voices are weak.  It\u2019s the way she forgives without bowing or plea,  The light in her eyes though no one else sees.  She dances not just when the spell lets her spin,  But in every small act where she chooses to win\u2014  Not over the world, but over despair,  With kindness stitched deep in the fabric of air.  Cinderella is courage in threadbare disguise,  A soul that still sings though it\u2019s wept a thousand cries.  She is not defined by the prince or the crown,  But by rising each morning and claiming her ground.  So when you seek beauty, look past the fa\u00e7ade\u2014  It lives in the fire, not the glow of a god.

Yet in the hush, a whisper stirs\u2014  A root beneath the frozen sod,  A breath that moves the alphabet of stars,  A language older than the gods.  For truth does not reside in height,  Nor solely in the vaulted dark,  But in the flicker of a candle\u2019s light,  In every question left unmarked.  It coils in roots, it hums in bees,  It hides within a beggar\u2019s laugh,  In trembling aspen, rusted keys,  In every footprint, every path.  So though we cease to scan the skies,  And gods retreat to myth and shade,  Truth walks among us, small and wise\u2014  A seed in ash, a blade in shade.  As less on earth seek truth above,  It kneels beside us in the dust,  And whispers softly: *I am love\u2014  Not in the stars, but in your trust.*",

The wound became a window wide\u2014  Through grief, compassion learned to rise.  And though the gate stood barred with fire,  Hope moved like wind through mortal wire.  So let the old tale twist and yield:  They were not lost, but learned the field  Where grace and error, hand in hand,  Till now, still walk through every land.  Adam and Eve were overcame\u2014  And from that breath, we bear the name.",

No angel\u2019s sword could cut the thread  of longing coiled within their bed  of thorns and stars. They walked, not fled\u2014  two ghosts inside a life half-said.  The soil resisted. Rivers wept.  Yet in the dark, their fingers crept  toward one another, bruised, aware\u2014  creation trembling in their hair.  They named the beasts, the moon, the rain,  but never dared to speak their pain.  Instead, they built with breath and bone  a garden they could call their own.  So let the old gods preach their fall\u2014  we rise from that first breathed call,  not cursed, but cracked, and strangely lit  by all the love that followed it.  Adam and Eve were overcame\u2014  and from that trembling, we became.",

I crossed the frost-bound meadows where stars were my only guide,  Beneath a sky of ashes, with shadows at my side.  Each bend in the current bore a name I used to know\u2014  Regret, and then remembrance, then a glimmer soft and low.  The current pulled with fury, tried to sweep me from the shore,  But the scent of your forgiveness kept me crawling through the door  Of dawn\u2019s first trembling color, where the mist began to part,  And there you stood beside the water, steady as a heart.  No bridge could have borne my weight, no road could have been true,  Only the river\u2014ancient, aching\u2014knew the path to you.  It took my tears to feed it, my sorrows for its flow,  And every wound I carried helped the hidden current grow.  Now we stand where waters calm beneath an open sky,  And the journey\u2019s jagged edges soften as we sigh.  For love is not arrival, nor a ribbon smooth and strong\u2014  But the river leading ever, even when the way was long.",

Thorns of memory clawed my arms, the wind spoke names I knew\u2014  Ghosts of those I loved and lost, now drifting out of view.

Not perfect, not untouched\u2014no, marked by storm and flame\u2014  Yet radiant with the current that had led me all the same.  For love is not the harbor, but the journey through the wild,  The breaking of the spirit, the weeping of the child.

Your eyes the dawn I'd wandered lifetimes for,  Your voice the shore I\u2019d never known before.  The river spoke no triumph, asked no praise\u2014  It simply wound away through wooded glades.
