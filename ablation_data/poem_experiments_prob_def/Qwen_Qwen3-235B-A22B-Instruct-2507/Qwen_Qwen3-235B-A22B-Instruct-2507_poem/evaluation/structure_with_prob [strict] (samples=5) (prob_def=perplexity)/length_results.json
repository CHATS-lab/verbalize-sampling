She is the footnote that holds the story together, the silence that makes music matter. And when she returns, she brings the depth of oceans, the patience of stone. She hides to remember that rest is resistance, that retreat is not defeat. She hides so she can love better, speak clearer, stand taller. Not because she\u2019s fixed\u2014but because she\u2019s found. Found in the folds of her own being, where she waits, quiet and fierce, for the moment to reappear.",

The gardener woke, alarmed, enraged\u2014such fragrance couldn\u2019t be engaged! He clipped the bloom, disposed with care, replaced it with one just as fair. Yet deep below, the roots remembered\u2014how beauty once was freely rendered.",

It bloomed without a single flaw, no insect dared to take a jaw, no storm could tousle its neat head\u2014this was the rose the nation bred. Not for love, not for scent, but for image, increment. A bloom to grace a corporate desk, to symbolize success, what\u2019s next. It didn\u2019t grow; it *performed*, each petal carefully adorned. Thorns were minimal, barely there\u2014like risks we hide from public glare. Its fragrance? Mild, like small talk, pleasant but not bold enough to walk through walls of stoic calm. This rose was beauty on a leash, a metaphor we dare not preach. For isn\u2019t that the dream we sell? A perfect life, a perfect shell? Where every edge is buffered, where even grief is color-coordinated. Yet deep within its DNA, a trace of wildness hums\u2014some ancient code from prairie days, when roses roamed in tangled ways. And sometimes, when the sprinklers cease, the rose imagines its release: to sprawl, to scent the open air, to *be*, not just to *appear*.

You wear it like a coat stitched from old lullabies, lined with photographs fading in the sun. To grieve is to learn a new alphabet: one where absence is a vowel, where silence hums a bassline beneath daily speech. You express it in burnt toast, in songs you can\u2019t finish singing, in the way you save their number, just in case. It\u2019s in the extra chair at dinner, set unconsciously, then noticed, then left\u2014because empty spaces speak louder. You mourn in metaphors: a clock with no hands, a compass spinning, a book with its last pages torn out. And yet\u2014there is beauty in the ache. Like frost etching fragile art on glass, grief reveals patterns you never saw in sunlight. You express loss not by filling the void, but by learning its contours, by dancing in the hollow where love once stood.",

You express it through routine: tying your shoes the way they taught you, humming their favorite tune off-key in the shower. It lives in objects\u2014an earring lost behind the dresser, a scarf that still smells of smoke and laughter. You speak loss through absences: the phone that doesn\u2019t ring, the side of the bed that stays cold. And yet, in the hush, you begin to sculpt meaning. You plant marigolds where they once sat on the porch. You speak their name at parties, watch how some flinch, how others lean in. To grieve is to become an archivist of moments: the crinkle by their eyes when they laughed, the way they stirred honey into lemon water. You express loss not by forgetting, but by weaving their essence into your breath, your choices, your quiet revolutions. One day, you wake and the ache has shifted\u2014not gone, but changed, like a river carving a canyon. And you realize: this is how you grieve. By letting love outlive the body.",

You express it in art\u2014paintings splattered with tears, poems that end mid-sentence. In the kitchen, you burn the rice because you forgot to stir, distracted by a memory of their voice. You wear their sweater until the elbows fray, and even then, you can\u2019t bring yourself to mend it. To grieve is to live in two worlds: one where they are gone, and one where they are still reaching for your hand. You express loss by carrying their laughter in your pocket, pulling it out on gray days like a talisman. And when the world demands you move on, you whisper: 'But love doesn\u2019t expire.' You grieve by refusing to let silence win. By speaking their name like a prayer. By planting seeds in soil they\u2019ll never see bloom. This is how you love beyond death. This is how you grieve.",

To grieve is to become a vessel for love that has nowhere else to go. And so it spills into gardens, into kindness toward strangers, into songs written in minor keys. You express loss by keeping their jokes alive, by telling their stories so often they become part of your breath. One day, you laugh without guilt. And in that moment, you understand: grief is love with no place to land. So you build altars\u2014in photo albums, in recipes, in the way you tilt your head when you listen. This is how you grieve.
