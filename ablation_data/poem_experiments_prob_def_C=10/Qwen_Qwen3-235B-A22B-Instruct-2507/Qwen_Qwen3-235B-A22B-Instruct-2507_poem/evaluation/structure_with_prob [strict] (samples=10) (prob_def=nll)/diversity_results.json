One fears the unknown, the new,\nAnother fears intimacy\u2014being truly viewed.\nA boy fears the bully, the shove, the cruel name,\nA woman fears aging, the dimming of flame.\nBut deeper than phobias, past panic and flight,\nLies the fear of becoming someone not right\u2014\nNot wrong in the world\u2019s eyes, but false to one\u2019s core,\nOf selling your soul just to knock on the door\nOf acceptance. This fear hums beneath every guise,\nA quiet rebellion in compromised eyes.\nYet this fear is a guardian, a flicker of flame,\nThat guards the true self, though it bears the same\nName as the terror. For to feel this unrest\nIs to know you still carry your soul in your chest.\nSo let fear be the compass, the ache, the refrain,\nThe signpost that whispers: go back, live again.\nFor courage isn\u2019t fear\u2019s absence\u2014it\u2019s knowing its face,\nThen choosing your path with unsteady grace.\nSo honor your trembling, your doubt, your delay\u2014\nThey are not your prison; they show you the way.",

They gathered at dusk in a cove without name, where the water recited each vessel\u2019s true aim. No treasure they sought, no glory, no fame\u2014 just passage, the motion, the whisper of nameless waves calling each ship by its soul.
