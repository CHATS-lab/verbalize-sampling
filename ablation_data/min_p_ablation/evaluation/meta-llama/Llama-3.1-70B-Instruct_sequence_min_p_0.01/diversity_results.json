But for those who fought, who bled and died, It's a harsh reality, they cannot deny. The stench of death, the screams of pain, The endless fear, the loss, the strain. So let's not joke, let's not pretend, That war's a game, a distant trend. For in its wake, it leaves a scar, A wound that heals, but never goes far. Let's remember, let's not forget, The cost of war, the lives we've met.",

It's the fear of being forgotten, of memories that fade, of love that's lost its way, like a river that's forever swayed. But still we hold on tight, to hope that never fades, to love that's always there, like a beacon that's forever displayed.

For some, it's spiders, their crawling skin, a phobia that makes their heart lock within. For others, it's heights, the dizzying fall, a fear that grips and makes them lose it all. But what of those who fear the unknown, the darkness that lies beyond what's shown? The fear of failure, of not being enough, a weight that presses, a constant, gnawing hunch. Everyone has a fear, a private hell, a place where demons dwell. Yet, in the darkness, there's a chance to face, to overcome, to find a steady pace. For when we confront our deepest fears, we find the strength to dry our tears. So let us not be ruled by fear's dark might, but shine a light, and banish the endless night.",
