Their feathers soft, their eyes so bright, a delight to behold in morning light, Their first flights, a wondrous sight, as they took to the open sky so free and light.

When it wanes, he's left with nothing, a hollow, empty space, a silence that's deafening, a crushing weight. He must find a way to reclaim his voice, to rekindle the flame that once burned bright, a guiding light. A poet loses his power for poetry, and with it, his sense of direction, a slow, aching, winding road. He must find his way back to the source, to the spark that once ignited his heart, to the poetry that sets him free.",

He searches for the spark that's lost, the flame that fueled his poet's boast. But like a fleeting dream, it's gone, leaving him with nothing but a hollow song. He tries to write, to let the words flow free, but all that comes is emptiness, a sea of nothingness that echoes with his plea.
