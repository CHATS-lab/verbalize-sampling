I could eclipse and cloud them with a wink, But that I would not lose her sight so long: If her eyes have not blinded thine, look, and tomorrow late, tell me, Whether both the Indies of spice and mine Be where thou left'st them, or lie here with me. Ask for those kings whom thou saw'st yesterday, And thou shalt hear, All here in one bed lay. She's all states, and all princes, I, Nothing else is. Princes do but play us; compar'd to this, All honor's mimic; all wealth alchemy. Thou, Sun, art half as happy as we, In that the world's contracted thus; Thine age asks ease, and since thy duties be To warm the world, that's done in warming us.

The heart, a heavy burden, bears the load, as tears fall like a summer's stormy road. Yet, in the depths of sorrow, a voice whispers low, 'You are not alone, your pain will slowly go.' The weight of loss, a mountain steep, but in its climb, a chance to find a way to keep. The memories of what's lost, a bittersweet refrain, a reminder of love, a heart that still remains. So let the grief unfold, like a rose in bloom, for in its petals, a beauty lies, a sweet perfume. A fragrance that reminds us, love never dies, but lives on, a memory that never fades, a heart that still survives.",
