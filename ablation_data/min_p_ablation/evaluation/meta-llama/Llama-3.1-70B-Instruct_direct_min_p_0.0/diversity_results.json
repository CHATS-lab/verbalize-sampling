Memories, like falling leaves, descend,And in the wind, our dreams do end.The fire that once, with passion burned,Now flickers dim, and love's concern.Yet still we chase, the fleeting hours,And in the darkness, search for flowers.But Time, the thief, with cunning guile,Steals all we have, and leaves a smile.And when we look, into the glass,We see a stranger, with a faded pass.The youth we had, the love we knew,Are lost in Time, and forever true.But still we hold, on to the past,And cherish moments, that will forever last.",

Memories of laughter, tears, and pain,Echoes that will soon be vain,The whispers of a love now past,A fleeting dream that will not last.The dust that settles, soft and cold,A shroud that wraps our stories old,The weight of years, the crush of fate,A slow surrender to an endless wait.We sink into the dust,A return to earth, a final trust,Our bones, our hearts, our souls, our all,Merging with the land, standing tall.In this vast expanse, we're but a part,A speck of dust, a fleeting heart,A moment's pause, a breath, a sigh,A whispered goodbye, a final goodbye.",
