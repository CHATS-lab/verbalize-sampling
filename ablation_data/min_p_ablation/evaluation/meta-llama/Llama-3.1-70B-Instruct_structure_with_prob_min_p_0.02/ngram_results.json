Lonely, a word, that echoes through time, a reminder of love, that's lost its rhyme. Yet, even in loneliness, there's a beauty found, a chance to rediscover, a heart that's unbound.",

Late school boys and sour prentices, Go tell court-huntsmen, that the King will ride, Call country ants to harvest offices; Love, all alike, no season knows, nor clime, Nor hours, days, months, which are the rags of time. Thy beams, so reverend, and strong Why shouldst thou think? I could eclipse and cloud them with a wink, But that I would not lose her sight so long; If her eyes have not blinded thine, look, and tomorrow late, tell me, Whether both the Indies of spice and mine Be where thou left'st them, or lie here with me. Ask for those kings whom thou saw'st yesterday, And thou shalt hear, All here in one bed lay. She's all states, and all princes, I, Nothing else is. Princes do but play us; compar'd to this, All honor's mimic; all wealth alchemy. Thou, Sun, art half as happy as we, In that the world's contracted thus; Thine age asks ease, and since thy duties be To warm the world, that's done in warming us. Shine here to us, and thou art everywhere; This bed thy centre is, these walls, thy sphere.",
