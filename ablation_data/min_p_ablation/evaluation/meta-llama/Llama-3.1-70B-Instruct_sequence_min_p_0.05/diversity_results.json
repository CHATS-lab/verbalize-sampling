For some, it\\'s spiders, dark and small, Their crawling legs, a fearful call, For others, heights, a dizzying fall, A loss of control, a fatal call. But fear, it\\'s not just things we see, It\\'s also what we cannot be, A fear of failure, of being alone, A fear of losing, of not being known. So let\\'s not judge, let\\'s not despise, The fears that others cannot disguise, Let\\'s offer hands, a listening ear, And help each other calm our deepest fear. For everyone has a fear, it\\'s true, But together, we can see this through, And though it\\'s hard, we\\'ll face our fears, And wipe away our bitter tears.\"][\"In the mirror\\'s gaze, a reflection stares, A fear that\\'s hidden, behind closed doors and snares, A fear that\\'s nurtured, in the darkest night, A fear that\\'s fed, by the flickering light. For some, it\\'s the unknown, a mystery untold, A fear of what\\'s to come, a future to unfold, For others, it\\'s the past, a memory that won\\'t fade, A fear of what\\'s been, a wound that won\\'t be made. But fear, it\\'s not just a feeling we can\\'t define, It\\'s also what we do, when we\\'re faced with the line, A fear of taking, a step into the void, A fear of losing, what we\\'ve employed. So let\\'s not hide, let\\'s not pretend, The fears that we have, until the very end, Let\\'s face our fears, with a courageous heart, And let\\'s not let, our fears tear us apart.\"][\"In the silence, a whisper\\'s heard, A fear that\\'s spoken, a voice that\\'s blurred, A fear that\\'s felt, in the darkest place, A fear that\\'s real, a feeling that won\\'t erase. For some, it\\'s the fear of being alone, A fear of losing, the love that\\'s been known, For others, it\\'s the fear of being found, A fear of being, in a world that\\'s unbound. But fear, it\\'s not just a feeling we can\\'t control, It\\'s also what we do, when we\\'re faced with the role, A fear of playing, a part that\\'s not our own, A fear of losing, what we\\'ve called home. So let\\'s not fear, let\\'s not be afraid, The fears that we have, will be displayed, Let\\'s face our fears, with a courageous heart, And let\\'s not let, our fears tear us apart.\"][\"In the shadows, a figure\\'s seen, A fear that\\'s lurking, a presence unseen, A fear that\\'s felt, in the darkest night, A fear that\\'s real, a feeling that won\\'t take flight. For some, it\\'s the fear of what\\'s to come, A fear of the future, a fear that\\'s been sung, For others, it\\'s the fear of what\\'s been done, A fear of the past, a fear that\\'s been won.

The mourners gather, dressed in black, their faces hidden, their hearts turned back. They follow the coffin, a slow parade, through streets that are empty, save the shade. The wind whispers secrets, as they pass by, of memories and love, that will not die. The night funeral, a time for tears, a time for goodbyes, through all the years. The darkness closes in, a heavy shroud, but even in death, there's a peaceful cloud. The mourners weep, their hearts aflame, but in the night, there's a gentle rain. That washes away, the pain and the fear, and brings a calm, that's hard to hear. The night funeral, a time to mourn, a time to remember, a time to return.",

For in the quiet, stagnation creeps, And growth, a distant memory, softly sleeps. The unsettled heart, a flame that burns, A beacon in the darkness, that yearns. It searches, striving, through life's plodding pace, For answers, truth, and a sense of time and space. And though it wanders, lost, without a shore, It's in this turmoil, we find what we've been looking for.",

In Eden's garden, once so fair, they walked in innocence and light, but now shame and fear did creep and snare, and banished peace from their sight. Their hearts, once pure, now heavy lay, with knowledge of their naked state, and though they sewed fig leaves to display, their guilt and fear did still await. Yet, even in their darkest night, a promise shone, a glimmer of light, that one day, love would make all right, and redemption's dawn would break the fight.",

But still they held on to love's pure flame, that burned within their hearts, a spark that remained, a light that guided them through the dark and the pain. And though they stumbled, though they fell, their love for each other, for God, did swell, and in that love, they found a way to heal, to overcome, to start anew each day.",
