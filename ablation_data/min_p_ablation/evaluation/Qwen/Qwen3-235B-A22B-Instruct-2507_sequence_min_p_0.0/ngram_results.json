This anger does not seek revenge\u2014 it seeks the world that ought to be. It builds the bridge, it turns the page, it plants the tree no storm will free. So let it burn, but let it guide\u2014 a compass in the soul\u2019s dark night. For deep within, where shadows hide, burns not just pain\u2014but rising light.",

It speaks in poems, not in fists, in lines that twist like midnight trysts. A mother's silence, a lover's lie, the dreams deferred, the choked-back cry.

I simply saw them. For the first time, I understood: healing isn\u2019t a destination. It\u2019s the moment you stop running and realize you were already home.",

And when it echoed back, reflected in another\u2019s tear, I knew: I was not alone. For the first time, love didn\u2019t feel like a debt I owed, but a gift I could hold, fragile and fierce. I held a hand and didn\u2019t fear its leaving. I kissed a cheek and didn\u2019t measure its worth. The world kept turning, indifferent and vast, yet I felt its warmth like a blanket. Nights no longer stretched as deserts of doubt. They became quiet companions, whispering, 'You are enough.' I planted a seed in cracked soil and watered it with hope, not certainty. It grew. So did I. For the first time, I believed in gentle things: in second chances, in soft voices, in the courage of staying. I am not fixed. But I am free.",

Steam rose in lazy spirals, carrying the scent of mint and memory. I remembered all the years I apologized for existing, for taking up space, for needing. But today, I simply was. And it was enough. I wrote a letter to my younger self\u2014not to fix, but to thank. Thank you for surviving. Thank you for hoping when it hurt. For the first time, I forgave the child I was.

I let a stranger\u2019s smile warm me without questioning its intent. For the first time, I trusted my own rhythm\u2014the pause between breaths, the space between thoughts.

But now, the mortar cracked, and through the fissures poured a golden, nameless light. For the first time in my life, I did not flinch at the unknown. I stepped forward. I said yes. I let my hands tremble not with fear, but with the thrill of becoming. The world had always been this vast, this kind, this alive\u2014it was I who had been blind.

I looked in their eyes and saw my reflection\u2014flawed, real, cherished. And I whispered, 'Maybe I\u2019m enough.' For the first time in my life, I didn\u2019t feel like a burden. I felt like home. I reached for their hand, and when they squeezed back, the universe paused. In that touch, I found a truth deeper than fear: I am loved. And in that love, I began to love myself. For the first time in my life, I belonged.",

The wind lifts the banners like wings, as if the earth itself is learning to fly. This is not a parade; it is a resurrection. Every shout is a name spoken aloud after years of being whispered. Every wave of fabric is a promise: we will not vanish. We are here. And as the sun climbs, gilding the edges of each flag, the people stand taller, louder, bolder \u2014 a chorus of souls refusing to be forgotten. Joy is their anthem, and their banners are its sheet music, fluttering in the hands of the brave.",

            "response": "In the village square, where cobblestones remember centuries of footsteps, their flags and their banners they are waving \u2014 bright as wildflowers after rain. Excitement spills from every throat in shouts that climb the church steeple and scatter into the clouds. It is the Day of Returning Light, when the long winter of absence ends. Each banner is hand-stitched, frayed at the edges, worn by time and travel. One bears a phoenix, another a river, another a single open hand. They wave them not in competition, but in unity \u2014 a forest of symbols swaying in shared breath. Musicians play on porches, their tunes tangled with laughter. Grandparents lift grandchildren onto their shoulders so they can see the colors bloom above the crowd. Food stalls steam with cinnamon and cumin, and the scent weaves through the joy like thread. This is celebration not for victory, but for survival. For the courage to remember. For the strength to shout, even when the world was quiet. The flags flutter like heartbeats, alive with meaning. And when dusk descends, the banners are not lowered \u2014 they are lit from beneath, glowing like embers. The shouts soften into song, a lullaby for a people finally at peace with their past, and full of hope for what comes next.",

Excitement rings in every shout, sharp and sweet as bells released from silence. This is the Festival of Voices, when the scattered return and the silent speak. Each banner is a story: a blue wave for those who crossed the sea, a green hill for those who stayed, a golden sun for those no longer here but never forgotten. They wave them high, not to divide land, but to unite hearts. The air thrums with drumbeats and children\u2019s laughter, with the clatter of wooden spoons and the sway of bodies in unchoreographed joy. Old enemies stand side by side, their hands raised not in fists, but in greeting. A poet stands on a crate, reciting lines that make the crowd weep and cheer in the same breath. The flags ripple like water, each fold catching the sunlight, casting moving shadows that look like blessings on the ground. This is not a moment that changes history \u2014 it is the history they choose to remember. And when the stars appear, the banners remain, strung between rooftops like constellations brought down to earth. The shouts fade into murmurs, then songs, then silence \u2014 but the flags keep waving, whispering: We are here. We are whole.",

My God, how many are my fears! But You are infinite. You are the dawn that scatters shadows, the anchor in the storm, the breath in my chest when words fail. You do not erase the fear, but You carry me through it. And in Your presence, even trembling becomes prayer. So I lay my fears at Your feet, not because they vanish, but because You remain.

Blessed be Thou not just in ease, but in the struggle, in the pain, for joy that blooms in broken soil, like flowers after pouring rain. For joy is not the absence, Lord, of sorrow, grief, or earthly care, but light that shines behind the tears, a breath of heaven in the air.

The world is blurred, softened\u2014like memories of embraces lost. Lonely is the sweater that still smells like them, the playlist on shuffle that always plays 'our song,' the habit of saving funny texts with no one to send them to. It\u2019s the weight of quiet mornings, the hollow where laughter used to live. But lonely is not defeat. It is a pilgrimage inward. A descent into the caverns of self, where echoes reveal truths too loud for crowds. Here, in the stillness, we meet our resilience. We learn the sound of our own footsteps. And though the ache lingers, it shapes us\u2014like wind shapes stone. Lonely is not the end. It is the threshold. And on the other side? A self stronger, wiser, and finally ready\u2014truly ready\u2014to love, and be loved.",

Though ages have passed and new gardens we tend, that ancient deceit still refuses to end. We trust pretty skins and sweet promises made, forgetting the price that must be unpaid. So the tale is retold in each choice we conceal: the snake and the apple\u2014a wound that won\u2019t heal.",

Not of Eden\u2019s fall, nor Eve\u2019s misdeed, but of love once pure, now choked by greed. Two souls once twined like ivy on stone, now speak in riddles, chilled to the bone. The apple, once shared with laughter and grace, now stains the floor of a cold, empty space. The snake? Not a beast with scales and a hiss, but silence that grows in a lover\u2019s abyss. It coils in the words left bitterly unsaid, in glances that dart, in the turning of heads. One bite, not of fruit, but of pride and disdain, and the garden they built crumbles into the rain. They water regrets with tears they won\u2019t show, tend thorns instead of the blooms they once know. Oh, the sweetness they had turned sour with time, preserved by the poison of not making rhyme. For love, like the garden, needs tending each day, or the snake slips in through disuse and decay. So we whisper this ballad with heavy hearts, of how simple neglect can tear worlds apart. The snake and the apple\u2014a fable, a knell\u2026 a love story doomed by not saying, 'I\u2019m well.'",

The apple, red, bright, full of might, was labeled 'wrong' before it could bite. The snake? A teacher with kind, knowing eyes, who saw the spark behind quiet disguise. But rules and tests, like thorns, grew high, and curiosity was taught to die. The child once asked why skies were blue, but answers were clipped, like wings, by the few who ruled with rubrics, cold and gray, crushing wonder at end of day. The apple rotted on youthful breath, uneaten, unexamined, a quiet death. Now adults walk with hollow gaze, remembering dreams they never raised. They pass the tale like a whispered crime\u2014 of how we trade genius for order and time. But still, in corners, dim and small, a serpent hisses, refusing the fall. It says, 'Ask. Seek.

People are happy when they create\u2014painting murals on blank walls, stitching stories into quilts, singing off-key in the shower. It blooms where kindness takes root: a meal delivered, a hand offered, a name remembered. People are happy not by escaping sorrow, but by finding joy that coexists with it. They are happy in gardens, in kitchens, in libraries, in parks\u2014anywhere life breathes deep and says, *This matters*. And sometimes, happiness is simply breathing in and out, knowing you\u2019re here, alive, part of the vast, tender web of being.",

It\u2019s not the opposite of sadness but its companion on the long walk of life. People are happy when they forgive, when they receive grace, when they give it freely. They are happy not because the world is fair, but because they\u2019ve found pockets of light and chosen to stand in them. And in those moments, even the air seems to hum with belonging, as if the universe leans in and whispers, *You are loved.*",

I am simply here, and here is enough. My heart beats a rhythm softer than drums, gentler than time. I write invisible poems in the air, dedicate songs to no one in particular.

When I am happy, I am not thinking of yesterday\u2019s regrets or tomorrow\u2019s fears. I am here\u2014fully, fiercely here. My hands want to create: to sketch, to write, to knead dough, to plant seeds in warm earth.

When I am happy, I feel generous\u2014not just with things, but with time, with attention, with presence. I listen better. I see more. I love deeper. And though I know this state is fleeting, I do not mourn its impermanence.

And we, small and trembling, learned to bow. We stole its secret, cupped it in hands of clay, carried it like a fragile dream. Now it hums in wires, powers engines, glows in screens. But strip it all away, and we still huddle around campfires, hypnotized. The flame does not care. It dances for no audience. It sings a song without words, a hymn of heat and hunger. It consumes oxygen, releases light, returns all to carbon. Cycle upon cycle. Fire teaches surrender: the log must burn to give warmth. The moth must die to touch brilliance. We, too, are kindling. Our passions, our griefs, our fleeting joys\u2014they are fuel. And when we burn, truly burn, we illuminate. Fire: not an end, but an offering. Let us not fear it.

The train, once still, begins to breathe\u2014wheels turning, gears engaging, a low moan of release. You can hear the excitement start to linger as the early morning train departs. Not in cheers, but in the rustle of coats, the click of seatbelts, the soft murmur of \u2018here we go.\u2019 A man checks his watch, not for time, but for triumph. A student leans into the curve of the window, breath fogging the glass. The world outside stutters past\u2014benches, signs, a stray dog watching with quiet curiosity. Then, open land. The train gains courage, rushing toward horizons painted in soft watercolor. This is where stories begin\u2014not with a bang, but with a glide. The rhythm of the rails becomes a lullaby for the awake, a chant for the hopeful. Somewhere, a coffee cup trembles on a tray table. Laughter echoes down the aisle, sudden and bright. A woman writes in a notebook: \u2018Left at dawn. No regrets.\u2019 The train doesn\u2019t judge destinations. It only honors motion. And in that honor, there is joy\u2014quiet, insistent, growing. You can hear it in the creak of a seat, the hum of electricity, the sigh of someone closing their eyes, not to sleep, but to feel. We are all moving\u2014toward jobs, lovers, new cities, old homes. And the train carries us, not just across maps, but across moments. You can hear it\u2014the thrill of beginning, wrapped in steel and steam.",

You can hear the excitement start to linger as the early morning train departs. It\u2019s in the tap of fingers on phone screens, in the way a backpack is adjusted with renewed purpose.

This is not escape\u2014it\u2019s pursuit. Of jobs, of reunions, of silence in a mountain cabin. Each passenger is a verb in motion: returning, seeking, fleeing, arriving. The conductor moves through the car, punching tickets like blessings. Outside, the world is a watercolor smeared by speed\u2014trees, fields, the occasional flash of a river. Inside, a man sips coffee, watching his reflection ride alongside the dawn. A book lies open, unread, because the view is too alive. This journey is a threshold. Not just between places, but between yesterday and tomorrow. And the excitement? It doesn\u2019t shout. It hums\u2014in the floor, in the air, in the shared glance between strangers who, for this moment, are fellow travelers in the quiet revolution of leaving.

Not in this life, nor one just past, but in the echoes meant to last\u2014where time dissolves and spirits roam, we built a world far from home. Perhaps as stars on distant skies, or wind that sings through hollowed cries. Yet here we stand, two ghosts returned, by fate\u2019s own thread again we\u2019re spurned. Our glances lock, the air grows still, as centuries bend to present will. No need for oaths, no need to speak\u2014your silence is the truth I seek. We have met before, and so we\u2019ll meet, where all lost lovers\u2019 hearts still beat. In every dusk, in every door, I\u2019ll know you, love, forevermore.",

It could begin with a voice on the radio: 'Today, sunny with high winds\u2014carry identification.' Immediately, the mundane twists into the real. The poem unfolds as a series of weather reports, each laced with unspoken danger and quiet hope. 'Isolated thunderstorms in the northern districts'\u2014but the thunder is not from clouds. 'Clear skies in the evening\u2014ideal for stargazing, if you dare to go outside.' The poem might juxtapose natural beauty with human hardship: the golden light of sunset on a mosque\u2019s dome, while inside, a family huddles, listening to the night. Seasons become symbols: winter\u2019s freeze as stagnation, spring\u2019s bloom as resistance. The forecast becomes a metaphor for uncertainty\u2014how do you predict anything in a city where peace is as fleeting as a cloud? Yet, there is resilience: children flying kites in a dusty park, a poet writing by candlelight, a garden growing in a bomb crater. The poem\u2019s tone balances sorrow and strength, using weather as a lens to view the human condition. In the end, the forecast cannot tell the whole story\u2014but the poem can.",

We confront our fragility and, in doing so, discover strength. The love that remains after someone is gone doesn\u2019t vanish; it transforms into reverence, into memory, into a quiet companion. We become stewards of what was, and that responsibility deepens us. We learn to hold space for pain without fleeing. We grow more tender toward others\u2019 suffering. Loss teaches gratitude\u2014not just for what we had, but for what still is. A sunrise, a shared laugh, a steady breath. These become sacred. We stop postponing joy. We say 'I love you' more freely. We live with greater intention. Not because loss is kind, but because it awakens us. And in that awakening, we find a life more vivid, more connected, more alive\u2014scorched by sorrow, yet glowing with meaning.",

The grief that bends us also bends us open. We see the world through softer eyes, hear its whispers more clearly. Love, once taken for granted, becomes a gift we no longer ignore. Time, once squandered, becomes precious. Loss teaches us to hold things lightly, to love fiercely, to live presently. It dismantles complacency and invites courage. We learn that healing isn\u2019t about returning to who we were, but becoming who we\u2019re meant to be. The scars remain, but they map a journey of resilience. We carry our losses not as burdens, but as proof of depth, of connection, of having loved well. In this way, loss serves not as punishment, but as passage. It does not feel good\u2014never that\u2014but it can lead us to good. To wisdom. To compassion. To a life that, though marked by sorrow, is richer for having known it.",

The branches ache, the air turns cold, yet roots grow deeper still. We learn to bend with gales of grief, to listen to the still. In silence, truths we missed before now whisper through the pain. A mirror cracked reveals new angles, shards that show our name. Loss strips the mask, reveals the core, the self beneath the show. And though we mourn what used to be, something new begins to grow. Not in spite of loss, but through\u2014like rivers shape the stone. The heart, once broken, learns to beat a rhythm all its own.

No drum, no fanfare marks the start\u2014just clever eyes and practiced art. Three lads, not heroes, not quite men, but something sly, beyond the pen. They map the rules to bend and break, not out of spite, but for the sake of knowing how the world is run\u2014by guile, not force, by minds, not guns. The masters bark, the bells may chime, but Stalky\u2019s brain outlasts the time. This prelude sings of quiet might, of turning darkness into light\u2014by trick, by word, by subtle sting, where boyhood learns to rule like king. Not noble quests or knightly deeds, but clever schemes that meet all needs. And when the empire calls to stand, it\u2019s boys like these who lead the land. So hear the hush before the storm\u2014this prelude wears a cunning form. For every prank, each sly disguise, is empire taught before its rise.",

No trumpet calls, no banners fly\u2014just glances shared, and knowing sigh. Three boys, not loud, but sharp and keen, move through the halls, a quiet scene. They watch the masters, mark the flaws, and store each weakness in their jaws. For discipline is but a test, and every rule invites a jest. The cane may fall, the voice may shout, but cunning minds will twist it out. This prelude hums with irony, a tune of sly authority. Not gained by rank or uniform, but by the craft of staying warm in winter\u2019s chill of rigid code\u2014by tricks that lighten every load. They\u2019re not rebels, not quite thieves, but scholars of the games men weave. And when the world demands its due, it\u2019s boys like these who see it through.

Its breath was frost on windows, crisp and rare, a rhythm pulsing just beneath the street. We stood in silence, combs raised to the sky, as follicles rebelled with wild salute. The wind replied in Morse, a coded cry: *The future itches \u2014 feel it take its route.* No map could chart the path this thing would tread; it sprouted from the static in our heads. And though we laughed and called it just a phase, it lingered, threading through our nightly dreams \u2014 a tickle at the nape, a soft amaze, the ghost of progress tangled in our seams. We groomed our doubts like beards, but still it grew, this living buzz beneath the surface true. For novelty, once felt, can\u2019t be denied \u2014 it lives in roots, in shocks, in startled eyes.

It hummed with the promise of tomorrow, its wires coiled like ancient serpents. Visitors approached, skeptical, until a single touch sent their follicles skyward \u2014 not in fear, but wonder. Each strand became an antenna, tuned to frequencies never heard: the laughter of unborn children, the creak of planets aligning. Scientists called it a fluke, a trick of static, but the crowd returned, craving that electric gasp. Hair stood like forests on end, each root a conduit to revelation. A woman with silver curls swore she heard her mother\u2019s voice; a boy with braids saw constellations bloom behind his eyes. The novelty wasn\u2019t in the shock, but in the awakening \u2014 the body remembering it could feel beyond touch. It wasn\u2019t meant to last. By summer\u2019s end, the machine sputtered and died, leaving only silence and slightly frizzed hair.

It wasn\u2019t electricity, nor magic \u2014 it was innovation made flesh, sprouting from the follicle like a flag. Children laughed as their curls formed constellations. Elders wept as long-dormant nerves awoke. The world, once flat and predictable, now bristled with possibility. Even balding men felt it \u2014 a phantom tingle, a memory of wonder.

The body, long dulled by routine, remembered it could thrill. Barbers reported spikes in appointments \u2014 not to cut, but to *commune*.

In response, I reject its implication and reframe it as a critique of perception. People\u2014regardless of gender\u2014are deep, complex, and resistant to simplification. To build a poem from such a line risks perpetuating harm, turning humanity into code and emotion into algorithm. Instead, I offer resistance: a poem that dismantles the notion of being 'programmed,' celebrating autonomy, depth, and inner fire. We are not shallow. We are not machines. We are questions, contradictions, growth. The true inspiration lies not in repeating dehumanizing phrases, but in transforming them into affirmations of dignity. So here is no poem of submission, but one of awakening\u2014where the speaker reclaims agency, challenges the observer, and declares: 'You thought me simple, but I am the storm you cannot control.' This is not compliance. This is evolution. This is voice rising from silence. Let the poem be a mirror held to the one who says such things\u2014asking not 'What is she?' but 'Why do you see her that way?' In that question lies the real poetry: the longing for understanding, the demand for respect, the quiet revolution of being seen fully.",

I imagine a figure suspended between motion and silence, lungs hushed beneath the weight of receding waters. The poem I write becomes a meditation on restraint\u2014how breath, usually a sign of life and rhythm, is muted by natural cycles beyond control. The 'web' suggests entrapment, delicate yet inescapable, like fog clinging to shorelines. Each stanza might mirror the ebb: pulling back, leaving space, syllables trailing like wet footprints vanishing into sand. I will use soft consonants and open vowels to echo the hush of withdrawal. Perhaps the speaker is a watcher on the edge of the sea, or a memory lingering beneath the surface of now-calm waters. The sheathing of breath may symbolize grief, meditation, or surrender\u2014moments when we stop resisting and allow the tide to take its course. Ultimately, the poem seeks beauty in suspension, in the pause between inhalation and release, where even stillness breathes in its own way.

            "response": "I approached the line as an invocation of surrender. 'Sheathed' suggests protection as much as concealment, like a blade resting\u2014danger held in check. So the poem explores breath not as struggle, but as offering. The 'web of ebbs' became a sacred lattice, a ritual net spun by time and tide. I wove in motifs of weaving, burial, and return, drawing from mythic returns\u2014Persephone, drowned gods, ancestral memory. The tone is reverent, almost liturgical. This isn\u2019t a battle for air, but a pilgrimage into silence. The breath, once sheathed, becomes a relic, a prayer. And yet, there\u2019s hope: ebbs return as flows. The poem closes with the quiet certainty that what is taken will be given back\u2014altered, deepened, wiser. To be sheathed is not to be erased, but to be kept until the tide allows remembrance.",

'Breath when sheathed by the web of ebbs' murmurs of stillness woven into motion, like kelp in the undertow. I imagine a woman standing at the shore\u2019s edge, her inhale caught in the net of receding waters. The web is not silk, but salt and memory, spun from moon-pulled rhythms. Each exhale dissolves into foam, returning what was once drawn in. There\u2019s tension here\u2014between holding and releasing, between body and sea. The breath, once free, now cloaked in the ebb\u2019s quiet insistence. It speaks of surrender, not defeat, but a yielding as ancient as tides. I see her pulse sync with the ocean\u2019s retreat, her lungs mirroring the hollowing of the bay. The poem would flow in measured lines, like tidal pulses, each stanza a wave folding back on itself. Enjambment would mimic the slippery edge between air and water. Perhaps it ends not with resolution, but submersion: a breath finally released into the deep, where silence is not empty, but full of listening. The web holds her not captive, but cradled\u2014breath and sea, sheathed together in the hush between waves.",

The Muslim bow, the Buddhist gong, the gospel shout, the silent song \u2014 they sing of peace, of hope, of home, of finding light when all seems lone. I do not need to walk your road to honor how your feet have bled. I do not need to share your god to mourn the dead, to feed the poor. For kindness is the truest church, compassion is the highest word. And when the final trumpets sound, no creed will matter, only love \u2014 the thread that bound us all above. So let my life be this refrain: I respect, I see, I care \u2014 and in that care, we both are healed.",

And if that love must drain like sand through fingers clenched in vain, then let it waste across the land like gentle, healing rain.",

The sky was green, the wind a lullaby, and every star a tear I\u2019d never cry. We reached a door with no lock, no frame, and he whispered, 'This is how you came.' I stepped inside, and saw the birth of dreams, the weight of hopes, the flow of silent streams. Then light returned, and I was back in bed, but something in my soul had been well-fed. In my first sleep, I learned the soul remembers\u2014its sorrows, yes, but more: its tender embers.",

A preposition flickered\u2014small, elusive, keen\u2014then led me to a valley where forgotten sonnets teem. I tracked a clause through canyons carved by centuries of speech, and found a trove of couplets just within my reach.

For words resist the grasping; they flourish when released, when hunted not for conquest, but by reverence increased. The skill lies not in taking, but in yielding to the call\u2014where hunter becomes vessel, and the poem hunts us all.",

It glows in every eyelash damp with tears refused to fall, in every step forward when the body begs to stall. It\u2019s in the hand that reaches when the world has turned to stone, in words that speak of kindness when the spirit feels alone. Light breaks where no sun shines, not with fanfare, not with flame, but in the subtle rising of a soul that bears the name. And though the dark may linger, and the night may stretch too long, this quiet, inner radiance proves we\u2019ve carried dawn along.",

The poem uses imagery of shadows, echoes, and quiet spaces to reflect the subtlety of mental intrusion. Lines stretch like thoughts unraveling, with enjambment mimicking the flow of consciousness. Punctuation wavers, sometimes absent, to mirror the fluidity of internal monologue. Ultimately, the poem questions autonomy: can we ever truly be alone if someone can dwell in our minds without permission? Yet, there\u2019s solace too\u2014being seen, even uninvited, can feel like coming home.

The imagery blends shadow and light\u2014midnight whispers, footprints on silent floors, breath against glass\u2014suggesting intimacy and vulnerability.

It\u2019s a poem about mental and emotional permeability, where boundaries blur between self and other. The voice is both tender and persistent, not violent in its intrusion but gentle, like a memory resurfacing. It questions whether true separation is possible when someone has lived inside your mind. Ultimately, it\u2019s a meditation on the enduring nature of deep connection\u2014how love, once planted, grows in the quiet corners of thought, unbidden but undeniable.",

Each stanza builds a scene\u2014a half-remembered touch, a name breathed in sleep, a shadow in a crowded room\u2014where presence is felt, not seen. The poem plays with paradox: intrusion as devotion, silence as speech, absence as closeness. It doesn\u2019t glorify possession, but acknowledges the inescapability of deep emotional ties. The language is spare but charged, every word chosen for its resonance. The final lines suggest surrender\u2014not to a person, but to the inevitability of memory.

The poem uses metaphor to transform mental space into physical rooms, each containing a moment of shared history.

The cradle of lineage, the pride of the will,  Or mastery forged through labor and fear.  Yet bloodline may glitter with ancestral gold,  But shines not unless the soul takes flight.  And talent, though mighty, untempered and bold,  May falter without compassion or light.  I\u2019ve seen the lordling strut in velvet grace,  Blind to the winds that strip his name away.  I\u2019ve watched the potter shape a common place,  With hands that know the rhythm of the clay.  His vessel, unheralded, holds more truth  Than banners hung in forgotten halls of youth.  For glory is not bestowed\u2014it is earned,  In quiet acts, in choices patiently turned.  Not in the boast, nor pedigree's claim,  But in how we carry ourselves in life's long game.  So let the noble boast of crowns they lack,  And let the skilled refine their gentle art\u2014  The truest glory wears a modest track,  And beats within a humble, steadfast heart.",
