I have not been\u2014nor wish to be\u2014  Bound to what the world calls free.  For in the absence, in the lack,  I found the map I kept turned back.  Now, older, frayed at every seam,  I wander still inside a dream\u2014  Not lost, but found in what I\u2019ve missed:  The self that childhood never kissed.",

Now when he speaks in riddles spun  From spider-silk and midnight dew,  I do not flinch, I am not undone\u2014  I listen, and the world feels new.  For in his eyes, so stark, so wide,  I find a mirror, clear and cold:  The sane are those who turn aside;  The mad are those who dare behold.  So let him stare with that old fire,  That trembling, luminous disguise\u2014  I meet him now, without desire  To cage the storm behind his eyes.",

It split the heart that beat with lies, the home built on deceit,  The altar where the weak grow wise by crushing the unbleat.  He spoke in parables of fire, of fields where tares entwine,  Of love that dares to climb the pyre, of wine that tastes like brine.  And every soul who took His name was asked to bear the blade\u2014  To die to self, renounce the game, unmake the masquerade.  So peace He left, but not the kind that lulls the world to sleep.

A sword\u2014not forged in furnace flame, but spoken from the Word\u2014  That cuts the knot of hidden shame, and judges every bird.

No lullaby of doves, no hush of gentle rain,  But thunder split the stable, and light became a chain.  He did not come on cushions, nor ride a lamb to town,  But tore the veil asunder where false foundations crown.  His peace was not a pillow, nor comfort for the blind,  But justice sharp and shining, cutting through the rind  Of complacency and custom, the temples built on sand,  Where priests trade grace for power and crush the helpless hand.  The sword he brought was mercy, laid bare against the bone\u2014  To sever lie from longing, to make the lost his own.  It cleaves the heart in two, then stitches it anew,  Dividing dark from daylight, the false from what is true.  Brother turns on brother, and kin against their kin,  Not from wrath, but reckoning\u2014for love must first begin  With sacrifice, with choosing, with standing in the breach.  The kingdom is not given; it\u2019s claimed beyond our reach.  So come, take up the sharpness, the fire, the hallowed blade,  For peace is not the absence where all discomfort\u2019s laid.  It is the sword that saves us, the wound that makes us whole\u2014  On the scene came Christ the Lord, to sanctify the soul.",

He walked where silence split in two, where truth and falsehood met,  And every lie, though long entombed, began to sweat and fret.  The plow of justice tore the soil where comfort had been sown,  And seeds of reckoning took root in marrow, flesh, and bone.  Not to bind the broken only, but to sever soul from guise,  To cut the knot of easy love that masks the hollow eyes.  The sword did not divide the wicked from the pure and meek,  But pierced the heart that feigned belief while love grew cold and weak.  Brother turned on brother then, not for blood, but for the light\u2014  One clung to shadow, one embraced the burning edge of right.  Mothers wept for daughters lost to truth they could not bear,  And fathers cursed the name once kissed in unremembered prayer.  He came not to console the world with whispers soft and kind,  But to cleave the self from self, and leave the true behind.  So let the blade descend again, though peace may seem defied\u2014  For peace is born of fire, and love must learn to divide.",

The garden wept. The sky drew back in shame.  The gates were barred, yet still the wind would blame  the curling vine, the tree, the fanged deceit\u2014  but who recalls the snake once had no feet?  Was it a curse, or transformation deep,  to slither where the upright dared not creep?  And Adam ate, not blindly, but aware,  and chose the fall because she lingered there.  Now every bite we take of sun-warmed fruit  holds echoes of that ancient, tangled root\u2014  not sin, perhaps, but knowledge, bittersweet,  and lips still stained with Eden\u2019s lost conceit.  The snake and the apple\u2014still we sigh,  two exiles walking \u2018neath the same wide sky.",

Rewind the fight, the slammed door,  the silence thick as winter snow,  the words you meant but didn\u2019t say,  now ghosts that through your veins still flow.  Rewind to love, its fragile bloom,  a hand held tight on midnight drives,  the scent of jasmine in a room,  the way a single glance revives.  But time is not a film to splice,  no edit button for regret.  We carry every choice and price\u2014  the living, breathing silhouette.  So remember, not to change the past,  but to feel its pulse, its ember.  Let each scar be a door ajar,  and love what lingers: *now*, remember.",

They grew like vines on a crumbling wall,  twisting, reaching, wild and true.  I knew the day would come when air  would claim what the nest once knew.  And one by one, they tested the wind,  leapt into the unknown blue.  Now the nest is hollow, lined with ghosts,  but the sky sings back in voices I knew.

Even the stones on the path seem to skip  when I pass, as if joy is contagious,  as if gravity forgot its duty.  Birds stitch the air with golden thread,  and the river runs not toward the sea,  but toward song.  My shadow dances behind me,  no longer a follower, but a partner\u2014  light as a secret, bold as a drumbeat.  When I am happy, the ordinary becomes myth:  a dandelion is a sun held low to the earth,  a puddle reflects not clouds, but constellations.  The grocery list turns psalm,  the kettle\u2019s whistle, a lullaby for gods.  And I wonder\u2014do I make the world bright,  or does the world allow me, at last,  to see what\u2019s always been there?  When I am happy, I am not just alive\u2014  I am the pulse inside aliveness,  the hush between heartbeats  where everything sings.",

Fire:  not just destruction, not just light,  but the pulse between wrong and right,  a breath that whispers, *I am, I was,*  the first word, and the final gasp.",

No hearth now warmed the hollow room,  No voice dispelled the gathering gloom,  Yet in the dust, a cradle swayed\u2014  As if some ghost still rocked and prayed.

The bell has tolled  For innocence. Now satire takes the stage,  And mischief, sharp as quills, begins to unfold  Within the cloistered warrens of the age.  No dragons loom, yet battles still are fought\u2014  With sly replies and traps of grammar laid,  Where masters preach of virtue dearly bought,  And boys conspire in ambush, unafraid.  A prank, a code, a lesson disobeyed\u2014  These are the arms with which they claim their throne.  The headmaster may scowl, his fury flayed,  But cannot crush the seed the boys have sown.  This is the prelude: ink-stained, sly, and keen,  Where laughter hides the edge of what\u2019s to come.  No golden age, no pastoral serene\u2014  But life, in all its cunning, beating dumb  And loud beneath the classroom\u2019s stifling drum.  Before the tales are told, before the name  Of *Stalky & Co.* is ever sung,  There burns the spark, the ever-flickering flame.  Not heroes clad in armor, clean and bright\u2014  But rogues who know the world is half a lie.  And in their jest, a kind of deeper light  That glints, like steel, beneath a clouded sky.",

The air is thick with Latin, smoke, and spite,  With flogged hands and unspoken scores,  And masters peering through the lens of light  That gilds the lie of discipline and grace.  Here, laughter is a weapon, sharp and low,  A coded tongue no rulebook can erase.  They walk the edge where mischief starts to grow  Like ivy choking pillars old and proud.  No heroes here, nor saints in sober gray,  But rogues who chart a crooked, clever way.  The bell has tolled; the game begins anew\u2014  Not fair, not kind, but fiercely, brightly true.  In every snicker, every well-placed snare,  Lies something deeper than the masters dare:  A bond that bends but never breaks apart,  Forged in the furnace of a boyish heart.

Footsteps stir in mud and stone,  Voices hushed, yet not alone.  Brothers rise with eyes half-open,  Ghosts of laughter, ghosts of home.  Hands that tremble, not from token  Of the cold, but thoughts that roam\u2014  Of a child, a name, a face,  Framed in love and time and grace.  Yet they stand, though hearts are aching,  Shoulders bent but never bowed.  For the path ahead is waking,  And the oath they made aloud  Whispers louder than the guns:  \"Duty done beneath the sun.\"  So march, soldier, through the morning,  Where the light and shadows blend.  Though the world lies torn and warning,  You are both the means and end.  Courage is not free from fear\u2014  It is love that brings you here.",

He shelters not with bolted gate, nor guards His love with sword,  But opens wide the ancient door with one forgiving word.  And in that grace, the weakest hand can rise and stand once more,  Not by their strength, but by the love that keeps them evermore.  So when the night grows sharp with doubt and faith begins to wane,  The saint still breathes beneath His wing, and dares to dream again\u2014  For God, their refuge, never sleeps, nor turns a deafened ear;  He holds them close, and sings them peace, and wipes away each tear.",

And though no judge or gavel marks  the justice that the wilds obey,  it writes its truth in blooming trees,  and in the breaking of the day.",

Voices hum in conference halls,  but no one truly answers calls  from the quiet voice inside that pleads,  *Remember me? I know your needs.*  Home again\u2014soup from a can,  the couch, the glow of some TV man  who laughs too loud, too long, too fake.  The dishes wait. The silence breaks  only when footsteps creak the stair,  or dreams escape a dog\u2019s soft prayer.  Then bed, where thoughts like moths collide,  flitting through the dark, denied  a flame, a purpose, just the spin  of *wake, work, home, eat, sleep* again.  And yet\u2014before the eyelids close\u2014  a star winks through the city\u2019s doze,  and in that flash, a whisper slips:  *This rhythm holds a soul that grips  not just the grind, but hope, however deep.*",

And in that giving, unasked and unmeasured,  something stirs: not solution, but solidarity\u2014  a fire lit not to consume,  but to gather around.  Where there is a need,  there too is the chance  to become more human,  to answer the silent cry  not with miracles,  but with milk,  with bread,  with a hand  reaching back.",

No star outshines the one that guides my way\u2014  It burns with all the words I\u2019ve left unsaid,  A constellation born from night and day,  Where love lives in the silence of my tread.  Though distance wraps me in its quiet shawl,  You walk beside me\u2014unseen, yet so near.  The quietest moments hold you most of all,  In every step, I feel you, crystal clear.  So let me walk through dusk and dawn\u2019s first hue,  For even in the loneliest expanse,  You are the thought that makes the journey true\u2014  My constant star, my soul\u2019s sweet recompense.",

No velvet words for men like these\u2014  They spat their truth on midnight breeze,  Their love a forge, their grief a flame,  Their laughter loud, their sorrow plain.

But oh, they danced when whisky warmed,  And in their eyes, the Auld Lang Syne stormed\u2014  A fleeting grace, a fleeting light,  That turned their grime to silver night.

They cursed the sky, yet bowed to rain,  And laughed as though they bore no pain,  Though hunger nipped and love slipped fast,  And promises were made to last  Just longer than the whisky\u2019s flame\u2014  A fleeting warmth, a whispered name.  He spoke of Burns, who knew their worth:  The dignity in breaking earth,  The beauty in a brawler\u2019s grin,  The holiness that lives within  A drunkard\u2019s tear, a rebel\u2019s cry\u2014  The poor man\u2019s dream beneath the sky.  And in his voice, the Ayrshire wind  Still stirred, still sang, still would not bend.  For though the years have smoothed the edge  Of hardship, loss, the body\u2019s pledge,  The spirit walks in boots of clay,  Still singing songs of yesterday.",

So no, I shall not waste in despair,  Though storms may rage and darkness glare.  For even in the deepest night,  A single spark reclaims the light.",

But just as dawn begins to creep,  A hush descends, the watchers sleep.  The veil grows thin, the edges fray\u2014  In my first sleep, I slip away.  And when I wake, the light is new,  Yet something lingers, deep and true.  A breath, a name, a ghostly rhyme\u2014  The echo of that first lost time.  In my first sleep, I still reside,  Where all my buried longings hide.  And every night, I take the leap\u2014  Back into that first, unbroken sleep.",

Time unspooled in whispers at the door,  And I, half-lost, half-found, could not decide  If I was guest or ghost, was loved or lore,  Or just the echo where a soul had cried.

Yet in the hush, when shadows creep,  You stir and sigh in guarded sleep,  Dreaming not of perfect grace,  But of a hand to claim your space.  O cautious flame, so bright, so shy,  Must trust be death? Must hope die?  For even guarded hearts may find  That scars don\u2019t dim the seeking mind.  So tremble, yes\u2014but tremble near  The voice that calls, the hand held clear.  For purity need not be lone\u2014  Even wary hearts may find their home.",

Yet in its center, tightly furled,  a whisper of root, of ancient world\u2014  a thorn that pricks, a stem that bleeds,  a silent plea beneath parades and creeds.  For even the perfect rose must ache,  must hunger for storm, for error, for break.  And when the last parade has passed it by,  it drops one petal toward the sky\u2014  not red, but gold with unapproved light,  a flawed, wild thing reborn in night.",

Here, in this nook of quiet grace,  Where thoughts drift slow like falling snow,  I trace the lines upon my face  And wonder where the years all go.  A book lies open, half-remembered,  Its ink like dreams I can\u2019t reclaim.  The world outside may storm or shimmer\u2014  I stay within this gentle flame.  For in this couch, so old and wide,  Lives every laugh and silent tear,  The moments lived, the ones denied,  The love that lingers, year on year.  So here I rest, and here I dream,  Upon this couch where solace grows\u2014  A quiet throne, a hearth, a seam  Where all my scattered being flows.",

No drum, no bugle sounds your proud retreat,  Yet silence rings with all you left unsaid\u2014  The mother\u2019s kiss, the child\u2019s unmet heartbeat,  The love that bloomed, then bowed its gentle head.  Your boots once marched where poppies dared to grow,  Now rooted deep in earth\u2019s unyielding keep.  The dawn you dreamed of\u2014soft with golden glow\u2014  Now paints the trenches where the quiet sleep.  Adieu, O soldier! Not in vain your breath,  Though time may veil the truth you died to shield.  The stars above still whisper tales of death  That birthed a peace no battlefield could yield.  And when the spring returns with timid song,  And rivers run with light instead of red,  We\u2019ll know your courage did not pass along  Unseen, unloved, unsung, and unled.  So rest, O soldier, where the lilies grow\u2014  Adieu, brave heart. The world remembers so.",

The earth receives you, not as one who fell,  But as a vow the living must compel:  To break the cycle, mend what wars have torn,  And greet each dawn not with a blade, but morn.

The world stripped bare of comfort, stripped of fault,  Reveals a truth in its austerity:  We are not warmth alone, but shaped by night,  By edges, absence, and the lack of sound.

The fig leaves trembled on the vine,  not from the wind, but the design  of eyes that saw, and could not unsee\u2014  the shadowed edge of liberty.  They walked where sunlight used to sing,  now hearing only the rustle of wings  that did not save, but only watched\u2014  arched backs and futures overmatched.  For to be overcame is not to fall,  but to awaken knowing all:  the cost of names, the price of breath,  the loneliness that follows death.  And still the earth recalls their tread,  two souls by love and loss misled,  who bore the world inside their shame\u2014  and whispered, *Was it worth the name?*",

For birth and skill, though bright, will dim and pass\u2014  But kindness lingers like the scent of grass  After the storm, when shadows start to lift\u2014  The truest light is how we gift our gift.",

For time unmakes the throne and levels fame,  And dust receives both scepter and the spade.  Not lineage, nor trophies won in game,  But kindness etched in how we live and aid.  So let me stand where honor is not bought,  But forged in deeds that no decree can bind\u2014  Where worth is measured not by what was taught  By birth, but by the grace found in the grind.",

Its current carved a crooked path through stone and silent bone,  And I followed, barefoot, bleeding, lost, yet never quite alone.  It whispered in the reeds at dusk, a murmur low and true,  A name I\u2019d almost forgotten, shaped from mist and morning dew.  Each bend revealed a memory\u2014some joy, some sharp regret\u2014  But still I waded deeper where the water\u2019s cold and wet.  The banks grew steep, the current fierce, it pulled me to the edge,  And I cried out into the void, clinging to a fragile pledge.  But then\u2014a light, a flicker soft, where willows leaned to kiss  The stream that bore my sorrow like a slow, forgiving kiss.  And there you stood, as if you\u2019d known the journey I had made,  Your eyes the color of the dawn after the longest shade.  No words were said, none needed, as you reached your hand to mine\u2014  The river\u2019s winding trial ended where your quiet light would shine.  Now we walk beside its waters, hand in hand, in step, in tune,  And every stone that bruised my feet sings softly to the moon.  For love arrives not swiftly, nor on gilded, easy wings,  But through the dark, through doubt, through storm\u2014the river led to you,  and everything.",

I walked with feet of sorrow, heart a stone beneath my chest,  Each ripple whispered warnings, each current put me to the test.  The water wore my footsteps, eroded hope like crumbling clay,  Yet still it pulled me forward, night dissolving into day.  I crossed the bridges trembling, where memories took flight,  And waded through the sorrows that drowned the stars from sight.  The moon became my lantern, the wind my only guide,  And every bend in current held sorrow, love, and pride.  I learned the names of stillness, the language of the deep,  Where secrets sleep in eddies and broken promises seep.  But then\u2014your voice, a current that stilled the storm inside,  Your gaze, a quiet harbor where all my wounds could hide.  The river did not promise an easy path or clear,  But only that it carried me, through every doubt and fear.  And now I stand beside you, where waters gently bend,  The journey etched in quiet, the ending without end.  For though the way was broken, though I arrived worn and sore,  The river led me to you\u2014and I am home forevermore.",

The river did not promise ease or speed,  Nor shelter me from every wound I\u2019d bleed.  It only knew the truth the currents keep:  That love is found where journeys run most deep.
