Now I sit by the window where evening unspools its gold,  and I learn stillness.  Not the stillness of absence, but of attention\u2014  the way roots listen to dark,  the way stars lean down to be seen.  Truth, you are not a sword I wield,  nor a flag I plant on conquered ground.  You are the quiet that comes after confession,  the weight of a hand that no longer pretends to hold.  So let me be a vessel shaped by silence,  a mouth that forms your name not to summon,  but to surrender.  Let me speak you not as master, but as echo\u2014  a life tuned to the frequency of listening,  where every pause becomes a kind of speech,  and every breath, a vow to hear before I say:  you.  you.  you.",

The red says, *Remember the blood we have shed,*  The gold: *We still shine, though the night seemed so dread.*  The green whispers, *Growth in the cracks of the stone,*  And blue hums a hymn in a language full-grown.  They wave not for kings, nor for borders drawn wide,  But for hands clasped in markets, for children who ride  Bicycles down alleys where bullets once flew\u2014  For the dream that the world could be tender and true.  The wind takes the banners, flings them high,  As laughter spills over the hills and the sky.  And in every flutter, in every cry,  There\u2019s a pulse, a promise: *We are alive.*  No longer in shadows, no longer in fear\u2014  Just people, and colors, and voices so clear.",

I walked where light and shadow kissed,  Unburdened by the weight of mist,  And laughter rang like temple bells  Through forest glades and mossy dells.

Two lunatics beneath one moon,  swaying slow in midnight\u2019s breath,  singing psalms to truths we\u2019ve outgrown.",

He speaks in riddles wrapped in velvet breath,  Unraveling time, insisting yesterday  Was dreamed by clocks that ticked their way to death.  The sky, he says, is stitching up the fray  Of stars that screamed when no one else was near.  I almost believe him when he draws me near.  His hands are steady, though his soul may burn.  He traces constellations on my skin\u2014  Old maps to worlds that no one else could learn,  Where endings start and new begins within.

So I return his stare, and for a breath,  The line between us trembles, thin as thread.  Perhaps the mad are those who fear the truth,  And sanity is merely being dead  To wonder, awe, and all the fractured skies  That blaze behind a madman\u2019s steady eyes.",

And though the night may stretch and yawn,  and stars refuse to speak,  lonely is the quiet throne  the heart learns how to keep.",

No olive branch, no gentle dove, no whisper soft and low\u2014  He came with justice, edged in love, to strike the roots below  The tangled vines of greed and pride, the temples built on sand,  Where priests grew fat while children cried, and law replaced the hand  That once had healed, had fed, had known the weight of human breath.  Now steel must cut where silence grown too deep for prayer or death.  He split the night with holy wrath, a storm in Galilee,  Not to abolish law or faith, but set the captives free\u2014  Free from the chains of hollow rites, from customs cold and worn,  Free to embrace the blinding lights of mercy newly born.  The sword he bore was truth made bright, a mirror to the soul,  To sever lies from love\u2019s true rite, to make the broken whole.  And still he comes, not soft, not mild, but fierce with saving grace,  To cleave the world of dream and guile, and call us to our place\u2014  Not in the comfort of the fold, but on the battle line,  Where love must fight to be consoled, and mercy learns to shine  With blade-like clarity, dividing dark from day,  For Christ the Lord still comes to say: \u201cI did not come to stay\u2014  I came to wake, to wound, to win, to make all things reborn\u2014  Not with peace, but first with sword, then peace beyond the storm.\u201d",

A household split in two, one called, one left behind,  The peace that cost a thousand deaths to purify the mind.  Not war upon the battlefields, nor conquests of the crown,  But war within the quiet heart where truth and shadow drown.

A mother\u2019s glance turned cold with doubt, a brother took a stand\u2014  The cost of love is division when love demands to be  Uncompromised, unsoftened by the world\u2019s forgiving tone.

One bite\u2014a crunch that shattered time and trust,  and turned the green to dust, the day to dusk.  No longer could they walk without the shame,  nor hear the wind without a whispered name.  The gates were barred, the cherubim took flight,  and Adam wept into the newborn night.  Yet still the snake is cursed to crawl and hiss,  and still the fruit is sought with fevered kiss.  For every heart that longs to know, to see,  repeats the fall\u2014reluctantly, but free.  Oh, sorry tale of hunger, love, and dread\u2014  the snake and apple live inside each head.",

For fear is not shame, nor a mark to disguise\u2014  it\u2019s human, it\u2019s honest, it\u2019s written in our eyes.  And when we stand trembling, yet choose to begin,  that\u2019s when we become more than we\u2019ve been.",

It sleeps in the silence between heartbeats,  in the hush before thunder, in unlit rooms.  Some fear the dark, not of night, but the kind  that lives in the mind, where memories drown.  Others dread daylight, the weight of the seen\u2014  the mirror, the clock, the names they\u2019ve outgrown.  There\u2019s fear of falling, and fear of the fall  that never comes, leaving breath in a stall.  Fear of the phone, the knock, the closed door,  the silence that means they won\u2019t come back anymore.  Children fear monsters beneath their beds\u2014  grown men fear the voice inside their heads.  Women fear hands they once called kind,  and the echo of love turned blind.  Fear of fire, of flood, of flying too high,  of living too long, of never asking why.  Fear of being forgotten, of being too known,  of facing the self in the seeds they have sown.  But in every tremor, every silent plea,  there\u2019s courage\u2014small, fierce, and free.  For to name your fear is to face it bare,  and walk through the dark, still breathing air.  So yes, everyone has a fear, it\u2019s true\u2014  but so too, everyone has a light they can choose.",

It reached a hand, not flesh, but mist and sigh,  And brushed my cheek beneath a hollow sky.  Then silence roared, and time began to fray\u2014  I woke at dawn, but something slipped away.

So let it come, the slow undoing,  The ache, the fall, the letting go.  For every loss, in time, is blooming  Into who we\u2019re meant to know.",

It\u2019s standing too close to the edge of the real,  Where the skin stands to attention, and truth starts to peel.  Oh, hair-raising novelty, wild and unkind,  You rattle the cage of the settled mind.  You are lightning in veins, a breath drawn too deep\u2014  The world, wide-awake, and no longer asleep.",

No clamor yet, no human sound\u2014  Just earth uncoiling from the ground,  A single moment, hushed and vast,  Where time forgets to hold it fast.  And I, a guest beneath the dome,  Stand wrapped in stillness, far from home,  Yet home at last, where mist has blown  Its cool truth into flesh and bone.",

The body, humbled, teaches its own grace\u2014  a temple dimmed, but never quite undone.  Now when I have a cold, I see the face  of quiet strength beneath the skin, the sun  still rising, even when I cannot rise,  still warming me through fevered, aching eyes.",

The weary find a featherbed, the broken, mended seams,  And hearts once torn by sorrow wake to more than dreams.

No tempest shakes His steady hand, no shadow dims His face,  He lifts the fallen with a breath, renews each failing race.  When thorns entangle weary feet and silence fills the prayer,  He walks beside in quiet grace, a presence warm as air.  The saint who stumbles in the dark still hears a gentle call\u2014  Not judgment, but a love that bears the weight of every fall.  He does not dwell in distant stars or thrones beyond the sky,  But in the hush between the breaths where broken spirits lie.  A shelter not of stone or beam, but mercy deeply sown,  A hearth where all the lost may come and claim they\u2019re not alone.  Through famine, flood, or famine of the soul, His hand remains,  A cup that overflows when hope runs thin like desert rains.  The weak find strength within His arms, the faint begin to sing,  For refuge is not just escape\u2014it is the heart\u2019s true king.  So let the world rage on its course, let mountains melt to dust,  The saint who leans on holiness is cradled in His trust.  God is the refuge of His saints\u2014eternal, strong, and near,  And in His shadow, we are home, unshaken, ever clear.",

For creed is but a cloak, not who we are;  a rhythm in the heart, a guiding star.  But deeper runs the pulse we all obey\u2014  the will to love, to labor, to obey  the quiet law that binds us, old and vast:  to live, to grieve, to hope, to breathe, to last.  So I respect not just in silence, but in deed\u2014  in planting gardens where all may feed.  For in the end, no altar stands alone\u2014  we worship one truth: we\u2019re never alone.",

No judge to call, no court to plead,  yet justice blooms from every seed.  No force compels, no threat is made\u2014  just time, and trust, and choices made.  So when the world feels cracked and wrong,  and sorrow sings its oldest song,  remember this: though none proclaims,  there is a law which guarantees flames  will fade to ash, and ash feeds bloom,  and silence births the coming tune.  There is a law. It does not shout.  It simply lets the world breathe out.",

Need is the compass, not the map,  the ache that charts a truer course\u2014  not where the gold or glory lap,  but where the unseen find recourse.  So when the void hums in your chest,  and you ask what use your small light might be,  step where the shadows press the best\u2014  for need reveals what love must be.  There, in the gap, the rift, the tear,  where hope seems thin as morning frost,  a hand reaches out\u2014and finds another there.  Where there is need, love is not lost.",

It rises from cracked earth, from unwatered roots,  from the child who counts stars instead of meals,  from the mother humming a lullaby with no ending.  It hums in the wires of unlit streets,  in the ink that fades from forgotten letters,  in the shoes worn thin by walking toward hope.  Where there is a need, a spark takes root\u2014  not in grand gestures, but in the tilt of a cup offered,  in the pause before a stranger says, *I see you.*  It is the thread pulled from a coat to mend another\u2019s tear,  the song sung low to a room full of shadows.  Need is not a wound that weakens,  but a compass that points toward grace.  It draws hands to build where there are no walls,  voices to rise where words have been buried.  It teaches us how to become bread for the hungry,  how to be water where the river has gone dry.  Where there is a need, there is also a way\u2014  not paved in gold, but in the quiet courage  of ordinary hearts learning to beat as one.",

Where there is a need, time leans closer,  Watches a child drink clean water at last,  Sees a letter reach a prisoner\u2019s cell,  And the future, though fractured, begin to cast  Its fragile net of maybe and soon.

The world moves on with hurried, careless feet,  But I am tethered to a softer pace,  Where memory and moonlight intermeet,  And love survives in silence, time, and space.  So when I walk alone, I think of you\u2014  Not lost, but held in every breath I draw.  The night is long, but love remains true,  And walks beside me, even without a flaw.",

They tilled the soil with stubborn grace,  Each furrow carved a prayer in place.  No silken words from lips untried\u2014  Just truth that bled and hope that cried.  They drank too deep, they laughed too loud,  They wore their sorrows like a shroud.  But in the hush when embers fell,  They knew the taste of heaven\u2019s well.  For Burns had shown them, wild and keen,  That beauty blooms where dirt has been.  That grace may dwell in crooked spines,  And stars still shine through smoke and grime.  So now I walk where rough winds blow,  And see in cracks the soft lights glow.  Not polished men, nor saints refined,  But souls unbroken, fierce, and kind.  And when I speak, I speak their name\u2014  Not flawless, but they burn the same:  A flame that flickers, dares, and clings,  Like poetry on workingmen\u2019s tongues.",

Yet\u2014hark\u2014a tremor in the gloom,  A whisper rising through the tomb:  Even dust may learn to burn,  Even hearts may twist and turn.  So let me waste, if waste I must,  But not in chains of frozen trust.  Let sorrow carve, let tempests tear\u2014  I\u2019ll rise a storm, not wasting air.  No more the ghost, no longer bent\u2014  From dying ash, my voice is sent:  \u201cI am not done. I will not fall.  Even breaking, I am all.\u201d",

The trees there spoke in syllables of wind,  And roots remembered every sin  And every kiss, each whispered vow  That time had buried, even now.

A clock without hands stood frozen in the hall,  And time unknotted, slipping from the wall.  A child with lantern eyes walked barefoot through  The corridors of things I once once knew\u2014  A shelf of shells, a coat left on a chair,  The scent of rain still tangled in my hair.

No puddle forms where my sorrows reside,  just silence that swells with a hollow inside.  They fall to the earth and vanish from view,  absorbed by a world that forgets what is true.  No trace of the ache, no mark of the fight,  just shadows that stretch in the dimming light.  I whisper my pain to the walls and the floor,  but echoes dissolve at the core of the door.  Even sorrow, it seems, must travel alone,  a ghost in the house of a heart turned to stone.  The moon watches cold from her throne in the sky,  she knows how it feels when no one asks why.  She wanes without protest, she hides her full face,  just like me, she\u2019s learned how to vanish with grace.  So I cry, though the tears don\u2019t remain,  they journey beyond where my grief can explain.  Perhaps they\u2019ll return as rain on the plain,  or rise as mist where the mountains remain.  But for now, I am dry, though the ache still abides\u2014  I cry, but the tears don\u2019t even stay by my side.",

Outside, the stars are cold and bright,  Unwitnessed by her averted sight.  She does not weep, she does not call\u2014  She simply is, and is not all.  For in the stillness, deep and vast,  She is both anchor and the mast,  A shipwrecked soul who cannot say  If she is leaving or if she must stay.",

Now she walks where shadows lengthen,  Carrying skies of buried rain,  A nation\u2019s hope, both fierce and gentle\u2014  Born in want, yet free from chain.  For though the land once starved and stilled,  It birthed a fire no drought can quench.  In her, the continent\u2019s will is willed\u2014  A dawn that famine could not wrench.",

But you stand at the edge, where the tides retreat,  Knees pressed to sand, pulse bittersweet,  Counting the stars like promises made\u2014  Each one bright, yet afraid to fade.  O forlorn heart, so tender, so wise,  Your guarded breath is a lullaby.  But what if love is not wound, not war,  But a door left open, a light on the floor?  Not stain, but gold in the cracks where you bleed\u2014  A wound not inflicted, but planted to seed.  So tremble, yes\u2014but let the door part.  Even pure hearts are meant to be hurt.  And wary wings, though long untried,  Were born not to hide\u2014but to open, and fly.",

Do you carve it in the bark of trees,  Let wind carry what words can\u2019t please?  Or fold each sorrow into paper birds,  Send them trembling toward blurred horizons?  Is it in the way the kettle sings  But no one pours the tea?  In photographs turned face-down,  Or keys left carelessly?  Grief is the guest who never knocks,  Who settles in the chair across,  Whose breath is felt but never seen,  Whose voice hums in the in-between.  You express it in the laundry left undone,  In singing songs that end at one,  In planting seeds you\u2019ll never see bloom,  In dusting rooms that smell of perfume.  It lives in hands that hover, still,  Above the space a hand once filled.  In how the world keeps turning fast\u2014  And how you whisper, *not so fast*.  So how do you grieve? You do not speak\u2014  You are the silence when the music\u2019s weak.  You are the shadow on the stair,  The weight of absence in the air.  You are the question, soft and vast:  *How can you grieve?*  And how, at last?",

Now scattered wide in sudden light,  They rise like dust in sunlit rays,  Whispering, *We were with you. We were bright.*  So shake the lint and dreams and fears,  Let all the small things speak their names.  The past is not a vault of years\u2014  It\u2019s loose change jingling in the flames,  A chorus from the depths, both near and far:  *We\u2019re all the pieces you still are.*",

The cushions hold me like an old,  Dear friend who asks no word of me,  And through the glass, the twilight\u2019s gold  Dissolves into a dusky sea.  Outside, the world may rush and shout,  With engines roaring, voices high,  But here, the silence settles out  Like snowflakes drifting from the sky.

The clock ticks slow, a patient beat,  As time forgets to pull me far.  This couch, a ship on quiet street,  Anchored beneath the evening star.  And in this nook where comfort grows,  Where breath is soft and thoughts run deep,  The universe, in stillness, knows\u2014  I do not need to move or speak.  Upon this cozy couch I sit,  And simply am, and that is all,  A soul held gently, wrapped in it,  The warmest hush of twilight\u2019s call.",

I have secrets too,  coiled like roots beneath my skin,  and I know how they hunger,  how they bleed into dreams,  how they twist truth into something  even the moon refuses to witness.  So keep your sorrows folded in cloth,  buried beneath floorboards,  whispered only to the wind.  I do not want to carry what you cannot hold.  I do not want to become the keeper  of your unraveling.  Let the unsaid stay buried.  Let the dark remain untouched.  For if I take your secrets into my chest,  I may never find my own way back  to the light.  And then, who will be left  to ask, softly,  \u201cAre you still there?\u201d",

So rest, O soldier, where the larks ascend,  Where peace is not a dream, but where you\u2019ve been.  And when the world forgets the drum\u2019s command,  We\u2019ll whisper still: *Adieu, O steadfast hand.*",

The rifles sleep; the banners softly fade.  No more the call, no more the parade.  Yet in the hush when evening starts to kneel,  We feel your pulse in what the willows feel.  Adieu, O soldier! Not a final word,  But echo carried by the wingless bird\u2014  A whisper sown in soil where sorrows part,  A quiet courage stitched into the heart.  So rest, not gone. The stars salute your name,  And every wind repeats your gentle flame.  Though earth may close, and time may drift and reel,  We keep your light in what we choose to feel.",

Adieu, O soldier, brave and worn,  Who bore the night before the morn.  Your name is carved in stone so pale,  A breath, a sigh, a whispered tale.  The children play where cannons fell,  And daisies rise from citadels.  The earth reclaims what war has sown\u2014  A quiet peace on splintered bone.

So let the frost-kissed heavens shine,  Sharp is the night, but not unkind\u2014  For in its cut, the stars align,  And pierce the dark with frost alive,  And wake the heart to what survives.",

They walked where shadows learned to grow,  Through thorn and dust, through doubt and dread,  Each step a seed of human woe,  Each breath a name the earth now said.  No garden gates could hold the cost  Of seeing clearly, love undressed\u2014  Two souls once naked, never lost,  Now clothed in shame, in want, in rest.  And yet\u2014beneath the ache, the blame\u2014  A pulse, a spark, a whispered vow:  To love again, though flawed, though lame,  To plant new gardens, even now.  For being overcame is not the end,  But where the human story starts\u2014  Two hands that break, then join, then mend,  Two hearts that beat against the dark.",

It mirrored skies of iron gray and stars that dared not speak,  And bore my sorrows in its arms like pebbles worn and meek.
