Red ripples of courage, gold threads of pride,  Green banners that whisper of roots in the soil,  Each fabric a story the wind cannot hide,  Each emblem a heartbeat, each fold a long trial.  They gather in squares where the shadows once crept,  Where whispers were law and the bold dared not speak.  Now laughter is loud and the children have leapt  To catch kites made of cloth on the breath of the week.  No chains on their wrists, no fear in their eyes,  Just hands raised as one to the vast, open sky.  The banners still wave, kiss the clouds as they rise,  And the shouting? It sings of a truth born to fly.  Not just in the noise, nor the flutter of thread,  But in every step forward, in courage outpoured\u2014  The joy is not fleeting, the hope is not dead,  It lives in the march of each newly unchained chord.

It\u2019s stitched in the cloth, in the rise and the fall,  In the anthem of people who\u2019ve known where they belong.",

Red for the blood that fed the roots of change,  Gold for the sun that crowns the bold and strange.

Children wave cloth like wings they long to own,  And elders smile at seeds they\u2019ve helped be sown.  The banners dip and dance, a living tide,  Carrying names no tyrant can hide.  Not just for triumph, nor a fleeting pride,  But for the quiet truth that walks beside\u2014  That joy unites what fear once tried to sever,  That many hands can build a home forever.  And in that shout, both tender and unbound,  The world remembers: *We are here. We\u2019re found.*",

The world moved on in bright array,  While I withdrew, apart, away\u2014  A ghost within my own design,  A breath, a shadow, half a sign.

They fear the kiss, the turned-back glance,  the empty chair, the second chance.  They fear the fall, the flight, the height\u2014  but most, they fear the lack of fright.  For in the calm, when silence clears,  I miss the weight, the old alarms.  My God, how many are my fears\u2014  and how I\u2019ve learned to hold them dear.",

No olive branch trembled in fingers of light\u2014  He shattered the scales with a blaze through the night.  The sword at His side was not forged by man\u2019s hand,  But honed from the silence between sea and sand,  From promises broken, from temples that fell,  From widows who wept and from prophets who fell.  He split the false comfort, the peace bought with lies,  Cut deep through the veil where deception still flies.  No treaty of shadows, no truce with the night\u2014  Only truth drawn in lightning, unyielding and bright.  Brother turned brother, and kin faced their kin,  For love cannot live where the cost has been sin.  He asked for no altar of incense or gold,  But hearts split wide open, courageous and bold.  So He rides through the ages, still wielding that blade,  Not to slaughter the humble, but shatter the shade.  And the sword is His mercy, though sharp as a thorn\u2014  For only what dies can be truly reborn.",

Not peace as the world gives\u2014soft, sealed, and ignored\u2014  But peace born of battle, of justice restored.  The sword cut the complacent, the proud, and the blind,  To free the imprisoned, the broken, the mind.  And though blood stained the stone where His footsteps were led,  It watered the garden where new life was bred.  So He came not with doves, nor a crown of gold thorn,  But flame in His purpose, a world to be reborn.  For peace without truth is a lie softly poured\u2014  On the scene came Christ the Lord, not with peace, but with sword.",

And Eve, with breath caught in the bloom of choice,  reached for the fruit, surrendered to the voice.  The crunch was small, the silence deafening after.  Leaves shivered. Skies turned gray. No thunder, no laughter.  They saw their skin, their shame, their fragile core\u2014  and Eden closed the door forevermore.  Was it a serpent\u2019s sin or hunger deep?  A fall, or just the cost of waking sleep?  The snake still coils in stories we recall\u2014  the apple rots, yet tempts beyond the wall.  Oh, sorry tale of knowing and of loss,  of bitten fruit and counting up the cost.

The wind hums low, a hymn without a name,  Of hopes that sprouted, then were burnt to bone,  Of children lost to distance, love to time,  And prayers that fell like seeds on stony ground.  Yet in the silence, something still endures\u2014  A root beneath the ruin, slow and strong.  For even here, where loneliness is law,  The heart sings soft: *I have been here. I belong.*",

It wears many faces: the knock in the night,  the loss of a hand once held warm and tight,  the mirror that shows what we\u2019re terrified to be,  or worse, what we\u2019re terrified we\u2019ll never be.  The diver fears depths where the light fades to black,  the singer, the hush when the music goes slack.  The writer fears blank pages, the lover, goodbyes,  the traveler fears roots, the rooted, the skies.  It gnaws at the edges of courage and calm,  a serpent curled tight in the heart\u2019s hidden palm.  Yet in facing the tremor, the stumble, the tear,  we discover the strength we didn\u2019t know there.  For fear is not only the thing that we flee\u2014  it\u2019s the edge of the self we must cross to be free.  So hold it, don\u2019t hide it. Let courage draw near.  Because everyone has a fear\u2014  and everyone,  somehow,  still walks through it here.",

It coils in the gut like old winter\u2019s breath,  or hides in the hush between clock ticks and dreams.  The child fears the dark behind the closet door,  not for monsters, but for the silence that speaks  in voices too faint to name.  The mother fears the phone\u2019s ring at 2 a.m.,  the way light might abandon her son\u2019s eyes.  The traveler fears maps that end too soon,  and the lover, trembling, fears the moment  when \u201cI love you\u201d means nothing at all.  Even mountains fear erosion,  and stars, the slow fade into cold dust.  Fear is not weakness\u2014  it is the pulse beneath courage,  the knot in the thread that holds us together.  It is the quiet companion  who walks just behind us,  reminding us we are alive,  that we have something to lose.  So when your hands shake,  when the night presses close,  know this:  you are not alone in your trembling.  We are all afraid.  And still, we rise\u2014  not because the fear is gone,  but because we carry it,  step by trembling step,  into the light.",

The bicycle with training wheels,  the scrape of knees, the taste of tears,  the way first love revealed its reels  in stolen glances, trembling fears.  Rewind to schoolyard chalk and dreams,  to dandelion clocks we blew,  to starlit nights and silent schemes  beneath a sky of endless blue.  Each moment, etched in fragile light,  a photograph the heart won\u2019t lose\u2014  the wrongs we wish we\u2019d set aright,  the love we failed to let break through.  So rewind life and remember,  not to dwell where shadows creep,  but to gather every ember  and kindle what the years let sleep.  For memory is not retreat\u2014  it\u2019s compass, lantern, map, and door.  The past we cradle, bittersweet,  holds keys to how we love once more.",

Let joy be small,  A cup held close, a name well-spoken.  Happiness lives not in the hall  Of triumphs loud, but hearts unbroken.",

Yet in the mire, a beetle gleams\u2014  Life clinging to these fading streams.  Not all is lost, though hope seems thin,  For even small pools hold light within.  And should the skies remember grace,  And pour their penitence apace,  These scars will bloom, these bones revive\u2014  The river may yet learn to thrive.",

And I, with open hands, returned their light,  a constellation born from quiet nights.  When I am happy, I am whole.  And in that wholeness, I belong to flight.",

It only burns.  And when the stars go dim,  and the earth forgets our names,  fire will rise again,  a golden tongue whispering,  *Remember, remember, remember.*",

I knew your silence, every pause, every thrill\u2014  And called you by a different name.  We have met before, in the breath between two thoughts,  In the pause before the bell is rung,  In every love that came to naught  And still, somehow, felt like coming home young.  Perhaps we meet again tomorrow,  Or yesterday. It hardly matters now.  The stars blink in an old, slow vow\u2014  We have met before. We know.  We know.  We know.",

Now time has cracked its fragile walls,  Yet memory in stillness calls\u2014  Not ruins, but a heart once warm,  A shelter shaped by love and storm.  And I, a stranger, stood and knew  That even clay can hold what\u2019s true.",

The wind, a mourner dressed in rustling black,  knelt in the grass and carried off each name,  each memory, each regret, each lack,  and folded them inside its endless frame.  And when the last foot turned toward the road,  the night remained\u2014its vigil still begun\u2014  not mourning death, but cradling the load  of love that walks when all goodbyes are done.  For night funerals bury not the dead,  but teach the living how to carry light,  through endless dark, with every tear once shed  a spark to guide them through the long, long night.",

So let the leaves fall, let them burn\u2014  From ash, the phoenix will return.  Not whole, perhaps, but more aware,  And strangely, deeply, breathing air  That tastes of both the salt and sun\u2014  Loss, it seems, is never done,  But shapes us, softly, into who  We were not brave enough to be\u2014  Until we had to be.",

Yet in the clearing, light breaks through\u2014  A softer world, remade and new.  Where roots once choked on clinging need,  Now space allows for different seed.  We learn the weight of quiet breath,  The value found in facing death.  Not all that fades was meant to stay;  Some partings clear the soul\u2019s long way.  We grow not in the sun alone,  But in the dark, when seeds are sown.  So loss, though bitter, sharp, and deep,  Carves out the room where we can leap.  Not joy, perhaps, but wisdom grown\u2014  Loss shapes the bedrock of the known.  And in its wake, though scarred and sore,  We find we can love more.",

No velvet tales of virtue neatly crowned,  But something raw, alive, and slightly sly\u2014  A prelude not to glory, but to grit,  To smoke-filled rooms where cleverness runs high.  So let the bells ring out their hollow chime\u2014  These boys will write their code in scuffed-up shoes,  In coded slang and schemes that bloom like fire,  And school, for once, feels less like chains, more ruse.  Not innocence, but wisdom forged in tricks\u2014  The world will scold, then wonder where they\u2019ve gone.",

And though the path aches and darkness still grows,  There\u2019s a step, and another\u2014  and the highway still knows  That even the weariest soul may still rise,  Chasing a dawn in forgotten skies.",

In closets, in corners, in rain-laced shade,  she gathers the pieces the world has frayed.  And when she emerges, soft and wide,  it is not because she\u2019s unafraid\u2014  but because even hiding has its tide,  and she, like the moon, must be obeyed.

She is not broken, only bent\u2014  bowed by the weight of being seen,  of smiles worn like borrowed coats,  of words that never quite belong.  The world is loud with expectation,  bright with eyes that demand her light.  So she retreats to shadowed rooms,  to corners dusted with forgotten names,  where the air smells of old paper and rain.  Here, she is not missing. She is choosing.  Choosing the quiet, the still, the bare.  Choosing to be a stone in the river,  unmoved by the rush, the pull, the cry.

No truth is owned, though many claim the map.  We walk different paths, but feel the same wind.  One heart beats beneath a thousand skins,  one hope flutters behind every eye.  So let me stand where bridges grow,  not walls.  Let my hand be open, not clenched.  For in your prayer, I see my own longing.  In your color, I find a deeper hue of home.

That's my window. Not mine to keep,  only to witness, to let it breathe.  This minute\u2014no promise, no end,  just light, and dust, and the will to attend.  And when it\u2019s gone\u2014this slant, this grace\u2014  I\u2019ll know I stood in the heart of the place  where time forgets its own name,  and all that remains is the window, the flame,  and the hush after calling your name.",

And in their gruff and weathered speech,  In every oath, in every cough,  There stirred a truth beyond reproof\u2014  A pulse beneath the coarsest proof.  Like Burns, they burned with quiet grace,  Not silk-clad bards with ink-stained hands,  But souls who found, in time and space,  The verse that grows where hardship stands.

I woke\u2014just briefly\u2014to the cold night air,  The ceiling\u2019s crack a map I knew by heart.  The dream still pulsed behind my breast, a flare  That dimmed but did not vanish when apart.  Then, slipping down once more through velvet deep,  I sought that song, that glow, that voiceless call\u2014  But dreams, like breath, will not forever keep;  They fade like footprints when the rain lets fall.

Oh, to be dreamy is not to be weak\u2014  It is to tremble, to feel, to seek  The pulse beneath the world\u2019s quiet skin,  Where all that is lost may begin again.  So let us wander, let visions unfold,  For in dreams, we are fearless, we are bold,  And the universe hums in our quiet refrain\u2014  We are dreamy creature, and we remain.",

I buttoned my coat with deliberate hands,  each clasp a small surrender to motion.  The mailman whistled past with letters  addressed to people I no longer am.  I smiled, not because I understood,  but because understanding had stopped mattering.  Even the clock, that old tyrant,  seemed to loosen its grip on the minutes,  letting them drift like dandelion seeds  over fences, into unknown yards.  And when the wind stirred the curtains,  it didn\u2019t feel like loss\u2014  only the quiet departure of what was never meant to stay.  Today was the day the world exhaled,  and I, at last, stopped holding mine.  The path ahead isn\u2019t clearer,  but my feet know it better.  Everything went on its way\u2014  and so, gently, did I.",

No thorn too sharp, no petal frail,  it wears its splendor like a crown\u2014  a scripted grace, a painted tale  of love and loss pressed gently down.  Its roots dig deep in red, red clay,  where history hums a quiet tune,  of promises made, then slipped away,  beneath a harvest moon.  It stands in rows, in manicured rows,  a symbol sold, a dream in bloom,  yet hides the ache that silence knows\u2014  the wilt behind the parlor room.  For beauty shaped by steady hands  can mask the storm, the silent cry,  the immigrant\u2019s toil on shifting sands,  the dreams that wither, slow and dry.  Still, in its heart, a fire glows\u2014  not flawless, but fiercely true.  Not just a bloom the catalog shows,  but red resilience, tried and new.  So let it stand, not just admired,  but seen: a thorn, a tear, a name\u2014  the perfect rose? No. But inspired,  a nation\u2019s soul in one red flame.",

You speak it not in perfect verse,  but in the stumble, in the tear,  in hands that reach for empty air  and find, somehow, something still is there.  Loss is not a wound that seals,  but light that changes as it falls\u2014  a hue that tints the ordinary,  and sanctifies the walls.  So grieve. Let absence be a song.  Let silence swell. Let memory bloom.  For love, once given, never leaves\u2014  it learns to live in the hollows of the room.",

It does not need the moon\u2019s consent,  Nor waits for day\u2019s bold argument.  It blooms where shadows twist and twine\u2014  A quiet sun, the soul\u2019s own sign.  So when the world seems sealed in night,  And every path is lost to sight,  Remember: deep beneath the ground,  New light is born without a sound.",

It is the dead of night\u2014  Not sleep, but something deeper:  The hush between two breaths,  The pause before the weeping,  The moment when the soul  Forgets the way to morning.  And yet\u2014  A single candle flickers  In a window far and small.  A hand, unseen, reaches  To part the heavy shawl  Of darkness with a whisper:  \"Wait. Dawn will come.  Hold on.\"",

A book lies open, spine half-bent,  Its characters now mine to keep.  The world outside may fret and vent\u2014  I guard the peace I\u2019ve settled deep.  The cat, a sage in fur and yawn,  Curls at my feet, a purring stone.  We share this hush, this dusk-worn morn,  This kingdom built of bone and foam.  Upon this couch, I am unmade\u2014  No name, no role, no weight to bear.  Just soul and stillness, gently laid  In corners of unspoken prayer.  And when the night exhales its end,  And stars retreat from eastern skies,  I\u2019ll rise, but part of me will bend  Back to this haven, soft and wise.",

She sweeps the ashes, yet holds her head high,  with stars in her eyes and the dawn in her sigh.  It\u2019s not the ballroom, the chime, or the clock\u2014  it\u2019s the courage to walk through the storm and the rock.  The beauty that lingers when glitter has fled,  the warmth of a voice saying, *I am not less.*  She is every woman who\u2019s been told to wait,  who\u2019s worn invisibility like a heavy gate.  Yet steps into light with a measured grace,  and claims her name in the mirror\u2019s face.  So Cinderella means more than a tale,  more than a prince or a magic gale.  She is the fire, the hush, the fight\u2014  the ordinary girl who becomes the light.",

Not just the slipper, not the gilded stair,  but how she carried kindness in the air\u2014  a light unshaken by the weight of scorn,  a dawn that blooms though night is heavily worn.  She swept the ashes, hummed a lullaby,  her eyes still holding summer in their sky.  No crown, yet regal in the way she bent  to tend the fire, to make a moment spent  on beauty hidden\u2014like a rose in frost,  a truth too tender, too profoundly lost  to those who measure worth by what is shown,  not what persists when all the world\u2019s alone.  Cinderella means the soul\u2019s own fire,  the unbroken thread of deep, unyielding ire  against the dark\u2014not rage, but quiet strength,  the length of love that stretches great lengths.  It\u2019s beauty not of mirror or of ball,  but how she rose despite the weight of all.  It\u2019s how she danced as if she\u2019d always known  the stars had written pathways all her own.  So when they speak her name, let it not mean  a girl who needed rescue from the scene,  but one who woke each day with grace in hand\u2014  a queen of cinders, dreaming into land  where beauty walks not in the silken gown,  but in the heart that lifts, and will not drown.",

Not just the slipper, nor the gown that gleams,  but how she walks through shadows, stitching dreams.  She is the hush before the clock strikes high,  the ember in the ash, the steady eye  that watches stars from windows smeared with grime,  still naming constellations in her mind.  Cinderella means the strength that stirs  when kindness wears a cloak of humble furs,  when laughter blooms despite the cold rebuke,  and dignity remains though others fluke.  She is the sweep of broom on stone at dawn,  the voice that sings when hope feels nearly gone.  Not magic spun from godmothers or glass\u2014  but courage forged where silence learns to pass.  She is the glance that holds no trace of spite,  the hand that gives despite the long night.  Beauty? Yes\u2014but not the kind that fades  in mirrors or in masquerade parades.  Cinderella means the soul\u2019s true face,  the light no step can crush, no time erase.  A fire veiled, but never quite undone\u2014  the world may miss her, but the stars salute the one.",

Not just the slipper, not just the gown\u2014  but how she rises when no one\u2019s around.  She is the sweep of a broom at night,  the grace in labor, the soft candlelight.  A beauty not born of mirror or glass,  but rooted deep in what hardships amass.  She speaks in whispers, yet moves like a flame,  her dignity unasked, yet never the same.  Not magic that lifts her\u2014though stars may align\u2014  but courage that lingers, both tender and fine.  Cinderella means kindness that stays  when scorn is the language of all of her days.  She forgives the cold shoulder, the door slammed tight,  and still walks forward, clothed in inner light.  She is not just the girl at the ball\u2019s golden door,  but the soul who could lose everything\u2014still wanting more.  Not beauty that fades with the turn of a head,  but beauty that blooms from the life that\u2019s been led.  So when you seek wonder, don\u2019t search for a crown\u2014  look low, where the embers still whisper her name.

Not born of silk or silver thread,  but forged in silence, soft and deep\u2014  a beauty that the world ignores  until the truth begins to leap  like sparks from ashes, bright and bold,  unfurling in the dawn\u2019s first gold.

She is not changed by gown or crown\u2014  the magic was within her all along,  a pulse, a rhythm, her steady song.

You carried the weight  Of promises made at the garden gate\u2014  Of home, of love, of children\u2019s song\u2014  But walked instead where the weak belong:  In trenches deep and frozen stone,  Where courage whispers, but stands alone.

Even when no one\u2019s keeping score,  she plays on\u2014  not for victory, not for glory,  but for the love of motion,  the rhythm of hope  in an unfilled stadium.",

The painter\u2019s stroke,  The poet\u2019s breath, the captain at the oak\u2014  These need no crest, no seal of ancient right,  Their light is kindled in enduring fight.  The cradle may bestow a gilded stage,  But talent earns the curtain\u2019s final page.  One inherits, one becomes\u2014such grace  Lies not in lineage, but in the race  Ran not for praise, but purpose, deep and still:  To rise by strength of heart, not blood, or skill.  Yet both may fade\u2014what lasts is how we give  Our glory up, so others learn to live.",

Time stilled. The river sighed. I knew I\u2019d found my place.  No longer did the miles accuse, nor cold winds scold my name.  The current, once my captor, sang a soft and steady flame.  You reached\u2014not with your hands, but with the calm inside your eyes\u2014  And in that glance, the journey\u2019s grief dissolved like evening skies.  Now when the moon leans low to drink, I touch your sleeping hand,  And hear the river\u2019s lullaby still threading through the land.  It led me through the dark and deep, through every twist and wrong\u2014  The river led me to you, and now, at last, I\u2019m home.",
