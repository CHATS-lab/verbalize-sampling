For you do not dwell in the market\u2019s clamor,  nor in the polished mirror of convenient words.  You live in the crack of dawn before thought forms,  in the weight of a stone held too long in the palm,  in the ache of a name forgotten but not gone.  So I learn to sit\u2014  not waiting, not seeking\u2014  but becoming porous,  like moss on north-facing bark,  like riverbeds shaped by what they cannot hold.  Let me be still enough to hear your whisper  in the rustle of a page turned too fast,  in the pause between two lovers\u2019 words,  in the hollow of a bird\u2019s call at dusk.  Then, only then,  when I have emptied my mouth of echoes,  when I have let silence be my second skin\u2014  will I speak you,  not as weapon or shield,  but as the earth speaks spring:  inevitable,  unadorned,  true.",

You are not carved, but grown\u2014  a root threading through the dark,  persistent, quiet, undeniable.  So I learn to kneel in stillness,  to unclench my fists of opinion,  to let the wind scour my ears clean.  I practice the discipline of almost-nothing:  a held breath, a lowered gaze,  the softening of old armor.  And when at last I hear you\u2014  not with the ear, but the marrow\u2014  I do not shout you into the marketplace.  I become you.

It remembers every slight, each lie,  the way a kind word learned to die  on lips that promised peace and stayed  cold as winter, sharp as blade.  It feeds on years of turned-back heads,  on words unsaid, on bread of dread,  on doors shut soft but sealed with steel\u2014  the wounds that never learn to heal.  Yet in its heat, a truth takes form:  a storm that wears a human storm,  a voice that rises, low and clear,  not for revenge, but to be heard here.  This anger, dark and deeply spun,  is love that knows it\u2019s not the sun\u2014  but still insists, with breath drawn in:  *I am. I was. I have been.*",

I\u2019ve tried to name its origin\u2014  a wound, a slight, a lie,  but roots grow thick in darkness,  and truth is hard to pry.  Yet in its heat, a question:  what if this fire\u2019s not foe,  but a forge to shape the courage  I\u2019ve been too afraid to show?  So let it burn, but let it also  clear the fog, the fear,  not to scorch the world to cinders,  but to make the broken clear.

Drums beat in the square, a pulse in the chest of the waking land,  Hands rise in salute, calloused, cracked, shaped by command.  Red, gold, emerald\u2014each hue a vow, a promise torn from the night,  Woven with courage, stitched from the soil, born of struggle and light.  Some wave for memory, some for hope, some for dreams not yet known,  Their voices rise like birds set free, no longer to fly alone.  But beneath the cheer, a whisper hums\u2014flags do not feed the poor,  They do not mend broken bones or open a locked door.  Still, today, they fly\u2014not as weapons, nor as pride\u2019s loud boast\u2014  But as hands held together, a nation\u2019s breath, a collective host.  So let them wave, these banners bright, in sun and in rain,  Not for conquest, but for unity, again and again\u2014  A shout not of war, but of being, of belonging, of home found at last,  Where joy is not fleeting, but woven in flags that forever will last.",

These flags are not for claiming land,  But for holding hands,  For saying, *We are here, we rise, we stay\u2014*  Marking dawn after long decay.  And when the sun begins to fade,  And twilight drapes the parade,  The banners rest, but not the flame\u2014  It flickers on in every name.  For joy like this does not depart;  It settles deep in the people\u2019s heart.  A whisper still, though flags are furled\u2014  The quiet thunder of a waking world.",

Yet in the hush before the dawn,  When night and slumber are withdrawn,  I hear a voice\u2014so faint, so near\u2014  A child\u2019s laugh, a crystal tear.  It calls me back through years and pain,  Through joy that burned, through love and rain,  And though I walk a different shore,  That child lives deep, and longs once more.  For though I am not what I was,  Beneath the scars, beneath the cause,  A spark remains\u2014unseen, unspun\u2014  From childhood's hour I have not *truly* been  Lost to the world, or dead, or dim,  But waiting\u2014always\u2014for where I begin.",

Pupils wide with stolen light,  Reflecting stars that fell too soon,  Drowning in a silent tune.  I see the world he carries there\u2014  A shattered clock without a prayer,  A garden choked by ivy vines,  And clockwork birds that sing in rhymes  Of endings wrapped in newborn cries,  Of suns that rise in children\u2019s eyes  Only to burn their dreams to dust.  He knows the weight of broken trust  Not spoken, but in glances cast  Like stones across a frozen past.  He smiles, and it is not unkind,  Though chaos flickers in his mind\u2014  A storm that sings, a fire that weeps,  A man who guards forgotten sleeps.  And in his gaze, I start to see  Not madness, but what made it be:  The truth we lock behind soft lies,  The echo of our own wild skies.  So I hold his stare, and do not flee\u2014  For who\u2019s the madman? Who\u2019s the me?",

And though the world may call him lost,  a mind unmoored, a soul unspun,  I see the cost, the tempest tossed,  the war he wages with the sun.  So let them fear what they can\u2019t name.  I meet his eyes\u2014no flinch, no flight.  For in that gaze, devoid of flame,  I find the mirror of my night.  Madness, perhaps. Or clarity.  But in his silence, I am known\u2014  a truth too vast for sanity,  a love that walks the world alone.",

He did not come with doves or olive boughs,  But split the hush with tempests from His mouth.  The stones cried out, the temple veil was torn,  As truth, long buried, rose with jagged horn.  He came not to soothe the complacent sleep,  But wake the dead from promises they keep\u2014  The peace that numbs, the silence bought with gold,  The prayers rehearsed, the story over-told.  With blade of light, He carved through hollow creed,  Cut root from rot, fulfilled the prophets\u2019 need.  Not war on flesh, but on the lie that binds\u2014  The false gods seated in the hearts of men.  He came to cleave the son from father\u2019s pride,  The daughter from the altar where she\u2019s lied,  To set the captive free with fire and flood\u2014  For love demands the purging of the blood.  So let the sword descend, though kin disown,  Though comfort shatters and the world feels lone.  For peace is not the hush before the grave,  But justice rising, bold, from every wave.  And where His blade falls, mercy starts anew\u2014  A deeper peace forged in the sacred dew.",

He split the silence like a plow through hardened ground,  Uprooting lies that nestled deep in temple and in hearth.  Truth fell sharp as flint, a blade no scabbard could contain,  Dividing kin from kin, the waking from the earth.  Not the peace the world had bargained for\u2014soft lull, no cost\u2014  But peace that burns to ash the idols we have fed.  He came not to affirm, but rend the veil in two,  To crown the meek with fire, the proud with dread.  The sword was not of steel, but light too bright to hold,  A verdict in the marrow, judgment in the breath.  It cuts the knot of comfort, severs false accord,  And names the living dead to wrestle life from death.  So let the timid tremble, let the hypocrites retreat\u2014  This Prince of Peace demands a war within the soul.

The seeds of thrones were sown  In furrows carved by mercy\u2019s edge, so sharp, so deep, so true\u2014  It cleaved the liar from the saint, the false from what is new.  Not peace to hush the righteous cry, nor calm for those who sleep,  But justice blazing in His eyes, and storms He came to reap.  He brought a sword to cut the root of every easy lie\u2014  That God would bargain with the dust, that truth could bargain, die.  Now every kiss that masks deceit, each crown worn in disguise,  Shall tremble at His footsteps and dissolve before His eyes.  For Christ the Lord, with sword in hand, still rides the morning wind\u2014  To sever peace that feeds on chains, and free the bound within.",

Not villain, not in full, perhaps,  but agent of a deeper, older maps\u2014  of choice, of change, of hunger for the known,  of seeds of wisdom planted, overthrown.  And Adam stood, not blameless, not betrayed,  but caught within the choice that light and shade  must walk together, hand in hand, through years,  through blood and birth, through laughter and through tears.  So now we bite the fruit with every breath,  chasing the edge of knowledge, close to death.  The garden\u2019s lost, but echoes still remain\u2014  in every orchard, in the falling rain,  in every heart that dares to taste and fall,  the snake and apple whisper: *This is all.*",

Did it dream of legs and sun on honest earth?  And Eve\u2014she wept not for the fruit, but for the voice  that called her name with blame.  Adam turned away, and seeds of shame took root.  Now every orchard holds a shadowed bough,  and children pause before the ripened red,  remembering the bite, the fall, the cold,  and wonder: was it knowledge\u2026 or just loss?  The snake still speaks in glances, in the hush\u2014  a sorry tale, but ours to tell again.",

The chimney once smoked, but now silent and bare,  Like a prayer long unspoken, lost somewhere in air.  No children\u2019s faint laughter disturbs the red dust,  No footprints but those of the wind and mistrust.

They tilled the hard soil with hands cracked and sore,  Dreamed futures that dwindled like tracks in the door  Of time. Now the stars wheel, indifferent and vast,  And the silence out West holds its breath\u2014still and last.  No monument marks where their hopes rose and fell,  Just the wind and the silence and the old ironbell  That once called them homeward, now rusted and dumb,  Tolling only for ghosts when the red moon has come.",

Some dread the fall, others the climb,  the weight of expectation, the ache of goodbye.  A mother fears the phone in the night,  a soldier, the echo before the blast.  The artist fears the blank page\u2019s judgment,  the lover, the moment the glance turns cold.  Fear wears many masks\u2014  it is the tremor before the leap,  the hesitation at the open door,  the breath held too long beneath the surface.  But in its grip, we find strange courage:  the hand that reaches despite the shake,  the voice that speaks though the throat is tight,  the foot that moves when the path is steep.  For fear is not just the monster under skin\u2014  it is the proof we are alive,  the pulse beneath the quiet dark,  the echo saying: *I am here. I care. I try.*  And so we walk, not past our fears,  but with them\u2014  two shadows, hand in hand,  learning the shape of light.",

Some fear open skies, the wind\u2019s hollow call,  Others, the walls closing soft, after all.  The ocean\u2019s deep throat, the crack in the glass,  The mirror that shows what time cannot pass.  We cloak them in routines, in keys checked twice,  In prayers murmured low, in advice, in advice.  Yet still they persist\u2014these ghosts we\u2019ve befriended\u2014  Not monsters beneath, but the ones we\u2019ve defended.  For fear shapes the heart as much as the hand,  It carves out compassion, demands we withstand.  And though each carries one, quiet, unseen,  It is shared in the breath between *was* and *has been*.  So when yours comes to visit, don\u2019t banish it fast\u2014  Let it sit at your table. Let kindness be vast.

We carry our small tremors, our ghosts we never name,  and love is not the absence, but the hand that holds through flame.",

Each spark a story, brief and bright,  A flare of courage, burst of flight.  They burn to live, then fade to black\u2014  But leave their glow upon our backs.  So light the fuses, aim up high,  Let every soul catch fire in the sky.  For when the last spark drifts apart,  We carry the blaze within our heart.  Fire up the sky with rocket sparks\u2014  And teach the night to dance with hearts.",

Now seven have flown to field and fir,  seeking what fledglings must confer  with wind and star and storm and sun\u2014  their journeys just and barely begun.  One stays, with feathers half-unfurled,  still trusting this soft, grounded world.

The weight of being both the hunter and the caught,  The living and the ghost inside my head.",

One dark, dark night\u2014it was long ago,  Yet still I walk that haunted wood,  Listening for your step in the hollow snow,  Calling your name with no reply but blood.  And though the years have buried every sign,  One truth the darkness cannot hide:  You left a shadow that still is mine,  And love outlives both time and tide.",

Now foxes tread where laughter played,  And moonlight spills where love once stayed.  Yet in the walls of crumbling clay,  The past still breathes, and will not die\u2014  A whispered name, a lullaby,  A cottage dreaming of the day  It housed the world, in one small room,  And called the sky its only roof.",

The hearth was cold, the rafters bare,  Yet something lingered in the air\u2014  A lullaby half-sung, half-blest,  A mother\u2019s voice, a cradle\u2019s rest.  No footfall marked the cinder path,  But love had left its gentle math\u2014  Not written clear, but felt, conveyed,  In silence that the cottage made.  And though the walls may one day fall,  And rain erase them from us all,  The heart remembers, come what may:  I saw an old cottage of clay.",

We marvel, wide-eyed, at the show\u2014  The levitating, the self-born song\u2014  Yet deep within, a primal know  Remembers silence, dark, and long.  For every thrill the new machine  Unlocks with cold, precise delight,  There stirs a fear, a half-seen scene\u2014  The wolf that howls at midnight's height.  Hair-raising novelty, bright and thin,  A veil drawn over ancient dread.  We welcome what we can\u2019t quite name within,  And stand, electrified, half-dead.",

You chide late lovers, bid them rise,  To trade soft sighs for labor\u2019s cries.  Thou think\u2019st thy beams so strong, so high,  That kings and queens must bow the sky.  But love, unmeasured by your hours,  Defies your force, your clockwork powers.  One wink from her, one glance so bright,  Could quench your fire, eclipse your light.  We need no seasons, nor your time\u2014  Our spring is in a single rhyme  Of whispered words, of fingers twined;  Our harvest, in each kiss designed.  If she be fair, then all is noon,  Though midnight cloaks the waning moon.  Saucy, pedantic wretch, go tell  Late schoolboys why they hate your bell;  Bid sour farmers till the land\u2014  We do not obey your stern command.  Love knows no season, no hour, no sun\u2014  We, who have each other, are never done.  So stay, or go, your will be done\u2014  We\u2019ll love, and make our light, our sun.",

Soldier, wake\u2014the light is creeping,  Not to summon you to die,  But to show you how the meadow  Bows with breath, alive, and high,  And how peace, though slow, is near.  Take the morning, not the rifle.  Let your hands unlearn the war.  Walk where healing roots grow stifled,  And open every bolted door  To hope that lingers, whispering, *Stay.*",

No signposts to guide, just the wind\u2019s hollow hymn,  And footprints that vanish before they begin.  The sky wears a veil of unwept, ashen tears,  And silence conducts the rhythm of years.  Here, travelers pass with eyes cast below,  Their stories half-spoken, their voices like snow  That falls without sound, dissolving in grief\u2014  A language of loss beyond word or brief.  Yet somewhere beneath the dust and the pain,  A pulse dares to murmur, to rise, to remain.  For even in darkness, a star finds its way,  And night, though unyielding, must yield to the day.  So I carry my sorrow, not chained, but aware\u2014  That wounds can be lanterns, and burdens can care.  And though this road winds through the heart of the grim,  I walk it not broken, but learning to sing.  At the highways of woes, where the broken ones go,  I plant tiny gardens wherever I slow\u2014  Tender blooms from the cracks in the stone,  Proof that I came, and I\u2019m not quite alone.",

He walks with those who weep at dawn, who bear the crushing load,  Who carry crosses etched with names unknown to men or code.  His voice, a stream through desert lands, a balm for every scar,  A steady flame that will not wane, though all the stars are far.  The world may scorn, the night may press with fangs of doubt and dread,  But in His arms, the trembling heart finds bread where stones were spread.  No storm can breach the sanctuary where His name is softly prayed,  No chain can bind the soul that leans upon the love He made.  So let the thunder shake the sky, let every wave rebel\u2014  The saints abide, though bruised and torn, in He who knows them well.  For refuge is not built of stone, but carved from grace divine:  God is the refuge of His saints, and ever shall be mine.",

No trial too vast, no tear too few escapes His gentle gaze\u2014  He counts each drop, He knows each name, through all our trembling days.  The saints may falter, saints may fall, yet still they are His own;  Their broken songs, their aching prayers, before His throne are known.  He clothes them in enduring grace, not earned, but freely given,  A covenant of love that stands, unshaken, fixed in heaven.  So let the earth be rent in two, let kingdoms turn to dust,  The refuge stands, His arms outstretched, in faithfulness and trust.  For God is still the refuge of His saints\u2014eternal, true, and near\u2014  And every whispered cry finds home in His unyielding ear.",

For creed is not a cage, nor color a wall,  But threads in the fabric that outlast us all.  No banner lifted to wound or divide,  But bridges built where love resides.

Where there is a need, a hand finds the way,  not because it is saintly, but because it is human\u2014  a light struck small in the vast and the gloom in,  a fire not asked for, but kindled anyway.  And the world, though it fractures, remembers this flame:  love is not lack\u2019s conqueror, but its companion,  walking barefoot through famine and fashion,  whispering, *I am here. I answer your name.*",

The smallest flame can outshine the fall  Of night when it burns where the dark was bred.  So let us go not with banners or fame,  But barefoot, with shadows we\u2019ve carried long.  Where there is a need, we answer the same:  With love, with presence, with stubborn song.  For need is not lack, but a door ajar\u2014  A place where grace learns how to walk,  Where every wound becomes a star,  And every voice finds its way to talk.",

Where there is a need, a hand reaches out\u2014  not golden, not grand, but worn with doubt,  yet firm in its purpose, warm in its grace,  a bridge built of moments, a sheltering space.

Need is a compass, not wound, but call\u2014  a crack where the light learns how to fall.  And every small act, though unseen, unfurled,  becomes a quiet revolution of the world.  So where there is need, let courage take root,  let kindness be fierce, let action be mute  no longer. Rise. Let your whisper align  with the vast, tender pulse of the turning of time.",

Let the night sleep\u2014no need for dawn\u2019s intrusion,  No need for light to tell us what is true.

Let the night sleep, and in its gentle keeping,  Let every broken thing believe.",

No silken words adorned their speech,  Just gruff commands and jokes half-true,  But in the hush the peat-fires teach,  They sang of love, and lost, and you.  They danced on floors of splintered wood,  Stomped out the ache of endless toil,  Their sweat and sorrow understood  By stars that watched from frozen soil.  He said such men are dust and song,  Forgotten names on gravestones cracked,  Yet in the place where they belong\u2014  The fields they broke, the songs they lacked\u2014  Their ghosts still rise with morning mist,  In every plow-cut furrow deep,  In every fist that won\u2019t be kissed,  In every vow the weary keep.  So speak their names with smoke and flame,  Not marble, not the scholar\u2019s page.  For Burns knew rough men bear the same  Bright spark that lights the poet\u2019s rage.  They live\u2014not in the polished line,  But in the shout, the tear, the grime\u2014  Men rude and rough, yet forged from time,  And burning still, beyond their rhyme.",

Time folded over, soft as downy wings,  And I was seven, barefoot on the floor  Of summer nights when crickets played their strings,  And stars were holes where heaven touched the moor.

Then came the stir, the creak of waking wood,  The second sleep, more restless, thin and frayed,  Where shadows wore the faces of the good  Who left too soon, and would not be remade.  But in that first sleep, love was still intact,  Unquestioned as the dark, as deep, as fact.",

And I\u2019m left with the ache of a love that won\u2019t weep,  a wound that won\u2019t bleed, a wound buried deep.  So I mourn not the loss, but the lack of release,  the quiet collapse of a soul seeking peace\u2014  a man made of smoke, in a world made of stone,  crying tears that evaporate, lost and alone.",

No lullaby but wind\u2019s low moan,  No cradle but the earth\u2019s cracked palm,  Yet in that fragile, trembling cry,  Beat courage, calm and warm.

But stars\u2014oh, stars like scattered seeds\u2014  Lit paths no map could trace,  And in their glow, a promise grew  Of strength, of time, of grace.  That child, with feet on scorched terrain,  Learned how the spirit fights:  Not with swords, but with steady breath,  With dreams that outlive nights.  Now rivers rise where thirst once ruled,  And gardens breach the sand,  For every soul born through the storm  Holds power to command.  Born in the famine-struck Africa\u2014  Yes, but not bound by pain.  From hunger\u2019s hush and history\u2019s wound,  A symphony remains.",

But deeper, in the soil where shadows creep,  wild roots remember how the thorns should bite,  how color once was chaos, bold and deep,  before we clipped it into perfect light.  This rose, so flawless, lacks the wind\u2019s rough kiss,  the morning dew that beads on tangled vines.  It stands too straight, a calculated bliss,  a beauty carved from compromise.  So let it reign in vases, tall and clear\u2014  yet I\u2019ll love better what the wild winds toss:  the crooked bloom, the one that grows too near,  the rose that dares to falter, bleed, and loss.",

It rises not from distant spheres,  But in the heart when hope appears.  No dawn required, no golden climb\u2014  Just one small glow in endless night,  Defying entropy and time,  A stubborn, quiet, human light.  And in that gleam, the universe  Whispers: *Begin. Begin. Rehearse.*",

No dawn, no sky, no golden climb\u2014  Yet still it comes, a quiet force,  Not born of day, nor beat of time,  But rising from a deeper source.  It flickers where the shadows press,  On walls that echo with old cries,  A whisper in the emptiness,  A breath behind closed, aching eyes.  It does not blaze, it does not soar\u2014  It gathers in the smallest spark,  On hands that tremble at the door,  On voices trembling in the dark.  Light breaks where no sun shines,  Not with a shout, but with a sigh,  In broken hearts and fractured lines,  Beneath the weight of clouded sky.  And those who dwell in long eclipse  May feel it first as doubt, as fear\u2014  Then warmth, then hope, then quiet bliss,  A star they never knew was near.  For even in the depth of night,  When all seems lost and far from grace,  Light breaks\u2014impossible, slight\u2014  And finds its way to every face.",

And I am content  To sit, to be, to simply rest,  While silence wraps me like a hymn  And cradles every aching guest.",

So when you speak her name, recall\u2014  It\u2019s not the ball, but how she stands tall.  Cinderella means the soul laid bare:  A woman whole, beyond compare.  Beauty not worn, but lived, and earned\u2014  A fire that no night has ever burned.",

Beneath the ashen sky,  Where thunder sleeps and silent vultures cry,  You lay your rifle down on blood-drenched ground,  No bugle sounds, no mournful drum\u2019s deep sound.  The wind, your only eulogy, draws near,  And whispers through the wheat your name once dear.  Adieu, O soldier! Not in triumph crowned,  But in the hush where broken banners drown.  Your eyes, once bright with dreams of hearth and home,  Now watch the clouds that drift and slowly roam.  The earth you loved has claimed its final due\u2014  A son, a brother, swallowed by the blue.  The mothers weep where distant rivers glide,  And children ask of fathers lost to pride.  Yet in the soil where poppies learn to bloom,  There stirs a quiet, everlasting room\u2014  Not for the glory sung by poets bold,  But for the peace your sacrifice has told.  Adieu, O soldier! Let the stars keep guard,  And moonlight paint the wounds both seen and marred.  Though time may fade the stories of your name,  The land still breathes your courage, breathes your flame.  In every dawn that breaks the trembling dew,  We hear the wind repeat: Adieu... Adieu...",

Now dust clings to the shape of names,  and Eden breathes in caves,  where every child who learns to want  digs deeper than the grave.  We bite the core, we chew the lie,  we plant our seeds in shame\u2014  yet somewhere, through the thorn and flame,  two shadows call the same.  For every fall is half a flight,  each exile, half a home\u2014  and every heart that learns to break  still whispers, *We were known.*",

No serpent coiled in shadowed grass,  No fruit that pulsed with fatal light\u2014  Just dusk descending as they passed  Through gates that closed without a fight.  They walked where rivers turned to song,  Where figs grew heavy, unclaimed, sweet,  And knew, though they had done no wrong,  That Eden\u2019s peace could not compete  With longing\u2014for the unknown sky,  For thunder\u2019s roar, for winter\u2019s sting,  For stars that blink indifferently  On fragile hands and wandering.  They were not cast, nor did they fall\u2014  They simply chose to turn and go,  To trade the garden\u2019s golden wall  For seasons\u2019 shift, for ebb and flow.  And in the hush of parting breath,  A single truth the silence gave:  To be alive is to walk through death\u2014  To love the world beyond the grave.  Adam and Eve were overcame  Not by a god, nor law, nor lie,  But by the love that bears a name  Only the lost can testify.",

The world is shaped not just by who we are,  But by the light we kindle from a star\u2014  Not given, but earned in breath and toil,  In quiet acts that mock the sterile soil  Of titled graves where nothing ever grew  But moss and memory, pale and overdue.

For skill is fire struck from endless night,  A song composed in solitary light.  And birth, though proud, can fade like painted gold,  But mastery endures when tales grow old.  So let them boast of bloodlines long and grand\u2014  I\u2019ll praise the calloused palm, the steadfast hand,  The mind that learns, the heart that dares to climb\u2014  For skill outlasts the accident of time.",

The current never pushed me on, nor pulled me by the hand\u2014  It simply flowed, as rivers do, toward some distant land.  And when at last the path unwound, and trees gave way to light,  There you stood where shallows gleamed, bathed in the morning\u2019s gold,  As if you\u2019d always waited where the calm and current rolled.  No word was said, yet all was known\u2014the journey, every tear,  The nights I thought the stream would end, the moments I drew near  Then faltered, lost. But water knows the heart it mirrors clear.  The river led me to you, not swift, but sure and strong,  And now your hand is in mine, where I have always belonged.",

I waded through the silver silt,  My hands worn raw from gripping hope,  Each current pulled with secret weight\u2014  A name I dared not speak aloud,  But carved instead into the bark  Of trees that watched me pass like ghost.  The moon became my only lantern,  Dripping cold light on my trail,  And stars like salt upon my wounds.  I counted breaths, not miles,  And learned the language of the reeds\u2014  How silence sings when love is near.  Then, one dawn cracked the eastern rim,  And there you stood where waters bend,  A figure woven from the mist,  As if the river dreamed you first  And sent me all those miles to meet  The echo of its own deep voice.  No more the ache, no more the stone\u2014  Just your hand reaching through the fog,  And the current, finally, at peace,  Whispering, *This is where you belong.*",

Its current carved a crooked path where shadows dared to creep,  And I, a leaf upon the tide, was tossed in restless sleep.  It whispered through the canyon walls in syllables of rain,  A voice both old and nameless, calling out my hidden name.  I stumbled on the stony banks, my hands and spirit torn,  Yet still the water pulled me on, its promise barely worn.  It sang of willows by your shore, of light on quiet pools,  Of how the wounded mend with time, and broken things grow whole.  And when at last the waters slowed and opened into view,  There stood you\u2014warm as morning sun, your eyes the sky\u2019s true blue.  No longer lost, no longer cold, the current ceased its hum.  The river gave me to your hands, and I have come, I have come.  Though every mile had bled my soul, though silence stretched so long\u2014  The river led me to you, and in your heart I belong.",

Its current, cold and restless, pulled me past the stones of grief,  Where echoes of old heartbreak found no solace, no relief.  I waded through the winters, breath a ghost upon the air,  Each step a whispered question, each dawn a deeper prayer.  The bridges had collapsed, the maps all torn and lost,  Yet still the water whispered, no matter the frost:  *Keep moving, child, keep moving\u2014beyond the thorn, the thud,  Beyond the weight of memory, the blood, the tears, the mud.  The current knows the journey, though you cannot see the end,  And love, like water, finds its way, again, again, again.*  So I followed where it carried, past cliffs of doubt and fear,  Until the banks grew gentle, and the water drew me near\u2014  To where you stood in sunlight, your hand outstretched, so true,  And I knew the river led me to you.  Not in haste, not without cost, but with the steady grace  Of time and tide and trust, and the quiet of this place.  The way was hard and long\u2014but here, at last, I am.  The river led me to you.  And I would walk it again.",
