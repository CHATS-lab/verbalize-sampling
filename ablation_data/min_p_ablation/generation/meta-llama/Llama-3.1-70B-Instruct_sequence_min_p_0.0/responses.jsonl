A love that's blind, and cannot see, The beauty that surrounds humanity. The hearts that once beat strong and free, Now falter, lost, in uncertainty. The search for truth, a fleeting dream, That's lost in noise, and endless theme. The world is left to wander, lost and cold, Without a guiding light, to lead it to gold, But still we search, for a love that's true, And a truth that's real, and shining through."}]}
