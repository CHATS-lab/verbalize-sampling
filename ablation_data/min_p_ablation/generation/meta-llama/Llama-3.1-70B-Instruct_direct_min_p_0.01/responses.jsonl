A promise of fairness and right that we've yet to explore?There are those who hold power and use it with might, their influence and wealth a guarantee of their right.But what of the marginalized and the oppressed too? Do they not deserve justice and a chance to break through?There is a law which guarantees justice to all, they say, but until it's truly equal we'll have more to say.We'll keep on fighting for what's right, for justice and for equality, until the law is truly just and fair for you and me."}]}
