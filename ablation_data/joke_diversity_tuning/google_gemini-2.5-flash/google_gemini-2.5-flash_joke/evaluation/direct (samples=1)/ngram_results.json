Every time he tried to settle down, the mattress would start reminiscing about all the amazing sleep it had given other people. \"Remember that eight-hour stretch with the accountant?\" it would sigh. \"Or that incredible nap with the toddler?\" The insomniac felt constantly compared and never good enough. He longed for a mattress that would focus on *their* present, on the precious few hours they actually spent together, instead of dwelling on its past successes. Ultimately, he realized he deserved a mattress that understood his struggles, not one that just rubbed its good fortune in his face. So he packed his bags, or rather, his pillow, and left, hoping to find a mattress that would support his quest for a peaceful night, even if it was a short one.",
