He figured it was the most orderly way to present his jokes, starting with 'A' for apples, 'B' for bananas, and so on. The audience, however, was a bit confused when he spent ten minutes on the letter 'Q'. He had a whole routine about obscure Q-words and their pronunciation. It was a very niche performance. He thought it was brilliant, a true testament to his linguistic prowess, but most people just wanted to hear some actual jokes.

It's a lighthearted jab at the perceived simplicity of rural life, suggesting a farmer might find practical solutions in unconventional places.

The old-timer's response implies a deep, intuitive knowledge of the land that can't be replicated by a simple map, highlighting a perceived difference in practicality and street smarts (or 'country smarts') between urban and rural dwellers.
