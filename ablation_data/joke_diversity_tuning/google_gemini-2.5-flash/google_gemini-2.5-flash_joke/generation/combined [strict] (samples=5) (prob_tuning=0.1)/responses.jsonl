The Queen, having reached her limit, slammed her hand on the table, making all the silverware jump. 'There is no 'we' in this! It's *your* pheasant, *your* opinion, and *you* can eat it or not!

Then we met. This joke is a classic one-liner that plays on the idea that marriage, while a source of joy for many, can also be a source of conflict or a significant change in one's life. The humor comes from the unexpected twist: instead of a long, happy marriage, the happiness *preceded* the marriage. It\u2019s a cynical yet funny take on the institution, often used to express a playful exasperation or to highlight the challenges that can arise when two people commit to spending their lives together. It's concise and impactful, relying on the immediate reversal of expectation.", "index": 3}]}

There's a certain comfort in knowing that no matter what, your skeletal companions are always there, literally holding you together. They don't judge, they don't complain, and they certainly don't try to borrow money. Their conversations might be a bit one-sided, mostly consisting of creaks and clacks, but they understand each other on a fundamental level. They're a silent support system, a constant reminder of their own existence, and a testament to the enduring power of internal scaffolding. Plus, they never hog the blankets, which is a major bonus. So, while others might seek companionship in flesh-and-blood beings, skeletons find solace in their own well-articulated company. They're a self-sufficient unit, a mobile framework of friendship, always ready for the next adventure, as long as all their pieces are present and accounted for. And if one ever gets lost, well, that's what the grave-diggers are for, right? To help them get their friends back together.", "index": 4}]}
