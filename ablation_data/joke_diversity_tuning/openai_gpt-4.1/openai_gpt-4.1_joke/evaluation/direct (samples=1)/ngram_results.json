Like, why is it that when you\u2019re trying to quietly open a bag of chips in a silent room, it sounds like you\u2019re performing in a fireworks show? But if you try to open it in the middle of a loud party, you can\u2019t get the bag open at all\u2014it\u2019s like it\u2019s mocking you for even trying.
