If I would call you forth in words, not hollow, not untrue,  Let me grow accustomed to the honest work of listening to you\u2014  To hear the world uncloaked, unmasked, the raw, unvarnished song,  And, trembling, find my voice in you, and know where I belong.For only when my ear is tuned to your persistent plea,  Will I speak you, Truth, in fullness, and set the silence free.",

The sun is a tyrant, the night is a thief,  Stealing the warmth from the bones of the earth.  A kettle sings softly, a song brief as grief,  And echoes drift out from the hearth\u2019s fading mirth.  No laughter, no voices, just cattle that roam  Between wire and scrub in a shimmering haze;  Yet here, in the heart of a world far from home,  Hope stubbornly burns through the long, empty days.  For hands that are calloused still cradle the land,  And dreams, like the wildflowers, stubbornly grow.  On a lonely selection, fate tightens its band,  But the pulse of the West beats steady and slow.",

But fear, for all its quiet weight,  Is not what makes us less\u2014  It\u2019s what we choose to do with it  That shapes what we confess.  So carry yours with gentle hands  And meet it where you are;  For everyone has a fear\u2014  It\u2019s what makes us who we are.",

In daylight we gather our courage like thread,  Weaving bright banners to hang overhead,  But darkness remembers the shape of our doubt,  And calls every trembling, unspoken thing out.  Some fear is a mirror, some fear is a door,  Some fear is the echo of footsteps before,  It lives in the spaces between every word,  In glances averted, in dreams left unheard.  We carry our monsters in pockets and palms,  Naming them gently, or masking with psalms,  We teach them to dance or to sit at our feet,  But always they follow, persistent, discreet.  Yet fear is a teacher, as patient as rain\u2014  It sharpens the senses, it colors the pain,  And sometimes, by walking straight into the night,  We find, in our trembling, the edges of light.  So if you feel haunted, or lost, or unsure,  Remember: you\u2019re human. We\u2019re all insecure.  But courage is born from the heart\u2019s quiet tear\u2014  And everyone, everyone, everyone has a fear.",

Sometimes she wants nothing but to rest,  Invisible, unseen, a breath, a sigh\u2014  To let the world spin on without protest,  And dream herself away, and not ask why.  Yet in that hush, a fragile courage grows,  Petal by petal, as the willow knows.",

I stalked the shadows\u2019 grammar, nimble, taut with breath,  My traps were patient listening, my bait was hope and doubt.  Some words eluded meaning, light-footed as a wren,  Some fell in startled flurries, eager to be let out.  I hunted words of skill, and sometimes, in the gloom,  I\u2019d find a golden sentence curled tight against the cold,  Or metaphors that shimmered like constellations bloom,  Or verbs that burned with hunger, impossible to hold.  Yet always just ahead, the wildest words would flee\u2014  A flicker at the margin, a whisper in the trees.  And so I walk the borderlands of thought and memory,  A hunter in the silence, trailing language on the breeze.  For skill is just the journey, the chase that never ends,  And words, the fleeting quarry, are both the means and ends.  Still, I hunt them in the darkness, I hunt them in the light\u2014  Those words that shape my longing and vanish out of sight.",

You cradle hope in porcelain hands, so fragile and so bright,  Afraid to mar its innocence, you turn away from light.

There\u2019s solace in the breaking, and in trust, a peace of mind.

Today was the day that the worries withdrew,  Each piece of my living returned to its place.  I breathed in the morning, and quietly knew  That sometimes the world moves with infinite grace.",

Perhaps it is the silence in a crowded room,  Where laughter echoes hollow against your chest,  Or the way the world continues to bloom  While your heart, in shadow, cannot rest.  It might be the ritual of folding shirts,  The scent of cologne on an empty sleeve,  Or the echo of footsteps on gravel and dirt\u2014  A presence you long for, but cannot retrieve.  Grief is a language without translation,  A song sung low in the marrow of bone,  A candle flickering in hesitation,  A yearning for arms and a voice you have known.  You grieve in the giving of flowers to stone,  In the stories you whisper to no one at night,  In the tears that fall when you\u2019re finally alone,  In the ache that persists beyond morning light.  To express loss is to cradle the pain\u2014  To let it reshape you, to honor the cost,  To gather the fragments and start again,  Carrying forward both love and the loss.",

A whispered footstep, gentle as a sigh,  I move between the words you almost say,  Tracing the hidden corners of your eye  Where dreams curl up, reluctant to decay.  I'll scatter questions in your silent room,  Plant seeds of wonder in the fertile dusk,  Let shadows shape themselves into perfume  And press their secrets, fragrant and unbrushed.  You might not know the moment I arrive\u2014  A shiver at your wrist, a fleeting ache,  A sudden taste of honey, sharp and live,  Or laughter in the echo of your wake.  And when the morning draws its careful line  Between the real and what you thought you knew,  You\u2019ll find me in the pause, the space, the sign\u2014  A name unspoken, trembling on the blue.  For I will haunt the hush between your days,  A gentle trespasser, a ghost of phrase.",

Still, her eyes flickered to the vacant schedule,  Tracing the names of rivals like distant storms.  What is rivalry, she mused, but another way to hope?  To believe in comeback, in whistles that split  The silence of longing.  We sat side by side, no roar in our throats,  No drums in our chests,  Just the gentle contest of memory\u2014  Her father\u2019s cap, the taste of autumn air,  That lucky scarf unspooled across seasons.  I told her the field was empty,  But she smiled, drawing lines in the dust,  Her heart inventing matches  Where none were played,  A victory in waiting,  A loss stitched sweet with time.  And in the hush, I realized\u2014  We are always waiting for our teams,  For that moment the world spins  On the axis of hope,  And somewhere, the game begins again.",

A blade of wind carves hollows in the dark,  Its icy teeth embroidering the air;  Yet far above, each flaring diamond spark  Is lit by hope too crystalline to wear.  O, listen\u2014how the silence hums with light,  A brittle song that only winter knows,  Where every constellation cuts the night  And bleeds a brilliance over sleeping snows.  The world is edged with longing, keen and bright,  Yet in the chill, a trembling grace survives;  Sharp is the night, but stars with frost alive  Remind the heart how beauty still contrives.  So let the darkness press with sharpened hands,  Let bitter winds inscribe their restless art\u2014  Still, far beyond the reach of frozen lands,  The stars endure, and kindle in the heart.

Sometimes I faltered at the ford, or knelt in mud and clay,  But hope was woven in the flow that would not turn away.I watched the seasons spinning out, the green of spring to gold,  The river\u2019s patience teaching me the courage to be bold.  It carried petals, broken leaves, old secrets never told,  And in its depths, a shimmer grew\u2014an ember I could hold.At last, the current stilled before a sunlit, waiting shore,  Your eyes were dawn, and all the years of wandering were no more.  The river led me to you, love, as it had promised long before\u2014  A journey traced in water\u2019s grace, and ending at your door.",
