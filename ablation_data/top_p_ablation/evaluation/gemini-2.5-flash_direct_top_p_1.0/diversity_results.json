For others, depths unknown,The cold embrace where no light has shone.A fear of failure, sharp and biting cold,The judgment of a story left untold.A fear of loneliness, a vacant space,No hand to hold, no solace, no embrace.Perhaps the fear of silence, stark and deep,Or roaring crowds where secrets cannot keep.The fear of change, a landscape shifting fast,Or of the past, its echoes built to last.The fear of loss, a cherished thing undone,Or of beginnings, battles to be won.A tiny insect, or a gaping maw,We carry burdens, bending nature's law.But in this shared vulnerability,A common thread, a quiet unity.For in our fears, we find a human grace,The strength to face them, leaving not a traceOf pure surrender, but a will to mend,Until our journey, bravely, meets its end.",
