There\u2019s hunger and heartbreak that twist in his stare,  A wildness that dances on edges of care.  His laughter is broken, a glass in the grass,  Reflecting the fragments of futures that pass.  He speaks in a language that logic denies,  A symphony sung by the lost and the wise.  His hands, like a poet\u2019s, are trembling and raw,  Each gesture a secret, each silence a law.  He stands at the threshold of reason and myth,  A question unanswered, a shadow to sit  By fireside stories where memory dies\u2014  He looks at me with a madman\u2019s eyes.  And I, in the hush of his tempest and woe,  Am caught in the undertow, helpless to go.  For something in madness is kindred to me:  A mirror, a longing, a key to be free.",

Oh, the world feels forgotten, the roads seldom pressed,  But peace is a guest here, a welcome, rare guest\u2014  On a lonely selection far out in the West,  Where the heart learns the language of quiet and rest.",

They are happy in the soft hush of mornings,  When the world is still gentle,  And the only sound is the promise of tea  Steeping quietly, steam curling like hope.People are happy in the half-forgotten songs  That linger in kitchens,  In the rhythm of feet tapping on linoleum,  Or the memory of rain on childhood roofs.  They are happy in the language of glances,  The secret handshake of old friends,  The weight of a sleeping child  Cradled against a heartbeat.Happiness, sometimes, is small\u2014  A pebble skipped across a pond,  A note tucked into a lunchbox,  A letter arriving with a foreign stamp.  It is not always the thunderclap,  Not always the parade\u2014  But the quiet certainty that,  For a moment,  The world fits gently in their hands,  And the sun, for them,  Is enough.",

When I am happy, I am less alone\u2014  My laughter spills, a ringing bell;  I find a kindness in the tone  Of strangers with their tales to tell.  When I am happy, sorrow seems  A distant ship on another sea;  I float, I drift, I dream my dreams,  And let the gentle world dream me.",

The trees bent close with their ancient sighs,  Branch-fingers tracing the blackened skies,  While somewhere a lantern, flickering gold,  Promised a story not yet told.  Cobblestones echoed with hurried feet,  A cloak swept by in the silent street,  And somewhere, a clock in a tower far  Counted the hours with a hollow star.  Inside, by the fire, an old woman spun  A tale of the night and the deeds undone\u2014  Of a promise broken, a ring cast deep,  Of a vow remembered when none could sleep.  The night, it listened, with velvet breath,  To the whispered bargains, the dance with death,  And outside the window, the darkness grew  With secrets the old night always knew.  So if you should wander where moonbeams go  On a night like that, from long ago,  Listen for footsteps, soft and slight\u2014  For the past walks quietly in the night.",

We have met before, in dreams that never fade,  In stories whispered as the fire dies,  In every ending, every new parade\u2014  We find each other, strangers in disguise.  We have met before, though lifetimes rearrange,  A thread unbroken, drawn through time and change.",

But hope, that restless animal, prowls the tangled yard,  It slips beneath the locked front door, it rattles in the vents;  It wakes us in the midnight hour, our hearts unguarded, scarred,  And whispers of the places gone, the roads we never went.  For comfort is a feather bed that slowly turns to stone,  And peace, too long unbroken, is a shadow in the sun;  We need the wind to shake the bough, the seed to be wind-blown,  The ache of longing, not yet stilled, the race not yet run.  So let us cherish hunger, let us praise the open door,  For only in the wandering does the spirit learn to soar.  Let us bless the questions, the wildness in the soul\u2014  For only the unsettled heart remembers to be whole.",

It is the hunger for elsewhere,  the restless longing that stirs  when night falls and silence  rings too clear.Unsettled, we are unfinished stories,  maps with blank spaces,  stars not yet named.  It is in the tremble of not-knowing  that possibility takes shape\u2014  each question a lantern,  each ache a door ajar.Let us not be too quickly settled,  not too eager to quiet the storm.

We gather close, we dare to touch,  Desiring beauty, wanting too much,  And sometimes bleed for what we crave,  Learning the price that the roses gave.

You grieve in letters never sent,  In birthdays marked in quiet rooms,  In silent prayers and time misspent,  In old bouquets and wilted blooms.  You grieve in stories shared at night,  In tears that come without a sound,  In reaching out, hoping to find  A trace of what is not around.  To grieve is to love with nowhere to go,  To hold the absence, cradle the ache\u2014  It is the shadow longing throws  When love endures what loss must take.",

Grief is a language with no vowels,  A song hummed through clenched teeth,  A garden untended, where wildflowers  Grow in the cracks of what was planned.

You grieve in the salt of your tea,  In the letter you write and never send,  In the way you pause before speaking,  Listening for a voice that is gone.  To express loss is to cradle the absence,  To hold it close as a fragile gift,  To let tears carve new rivers in your heart\u2014  Until, one day, you find yourself singing  A song you thought you\u2019d forgotten,  And feel the presence of love in the silence  That loss, for all its sorrow, leaves behind.",

A poet pens a secret verse,  A lover lifts a silent prayer\u2014  The longing for a universe  Where answers float in open air.So though the numbers may grow small,  And fewer faces turn above,  The ache for meaning stirs in all,  A whisper woven into love.

Still, she spun a ball on her fingertip,  the sun catching the scuffed leather,  and told me how sometimes  the best matches happen off the record\u2014  in alleys, in dreams, in hearts that refuse  to sit out the season.She drew a chalk goal on the driveway,  her feet tracing stories across the concrete,  and cheered for invisible players  who never missed a pass.  I watched her, half in shadow,  half in the light of her own making,  and wondered if the game was ever  about the teams at all\u2014  or if, in the end, it was always  about the playing.",

So we walked through the silence, inventing our cheers,  And played out the match in the field of our years.",
