A brittle thread,That held the dam, a word unsaid.A silent hum, a constant strain,Now shattered, echoing in the rain.The air grew thin, the colours bled,As something vital, deep inside, fled.A quiet hum, a steady beat,Now fractured, broken, incomplete.No sudden crash, no thunder's roar,Just a whisper, then nothing more.A fragile peace, meticulously built,Now scattered, like a forgotten quilt.The weight released, a heavy sigh,As the last resistance drifted by.A quiet surrender, a letting go,A stark acceptance, soft and slow.The pieces lie, a scattered mess,A testament to weariness.But in the rubble, a space appears,For something new, beyond the tears."}]}

A brittle thread of calm,The silent hum that held the world in check.No gentle sigh, no whisper of alarm,Just sudden rupture, leaving ruin's wreck.The dam that held the surging tide of doubt,A fragile wall against the rising fear,Gave way with force, and let the madness out,A torrent washing all that once was clear.The patience worn, a thin and tattered cloth,Unraveled fast, beyond all hope of mend.A whispered promise, turning into froth,As loyalties and friendships found their end.The mask it wore, a smile both fixed and bright,Cracked into pieces, scattered on the floor.Revealing shadows, born of endless night,A primal scream where silence reigned before.And in that break, a freedom, stark and raw,A truth unleashed, no longer to be bound.A new beginning, born of every flaw,Where shattered pieces might at last be found."}]}
