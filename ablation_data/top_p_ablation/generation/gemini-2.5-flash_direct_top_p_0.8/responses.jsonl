A brittle thread, so fine,That held the dam of patience, yours and mine.A tiny crack, a whisper, then a groan,Now shattered fragments, scattered and alone.The carefully constructed, painted smile,That masked the tempest brewing for a while,Has crumbled, showing what lay deep inside,A roaring ocean, where the shadows hide.The gentle words, the placid, calm veneer,All gone, replaced by something raw and clear.A silent scream that echoes through the air,A heavy burden, lifted from despair.No more pretense, no more the careful tread,The fragile peace, now utterly unsaid.A breaking point, a truth that could not hold,A story whispered, now bravely told.And in that snap, a strange, liberating grace,A chance to mend, or find a different space.The old is broken, never to return,A new beginning, lessons we must learn."}]}
