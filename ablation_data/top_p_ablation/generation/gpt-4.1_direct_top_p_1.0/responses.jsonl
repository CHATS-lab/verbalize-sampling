The banners\u2014so hopeful\u2014proclaim what might be,  A future unspooling in crimson and blue;  Each voice in the chorus, a wish made aloud,  A hope that the world can begin anew.  They dance in the shadow of buildings and doubt,  But sunlight is winning, it streams without care,  And every small banner, each jubilant shout,  Is proof that the dreamers still gather out there.  So wave your own banner, let joy lift your voice,  For today we are many, united, and proud\u2014  Our spirits uplifted, our hearts given choice,  Excitement and hope in the swell of the crowd."}]}

Yet still, amid the trembling dark,  A single ember, faint but true,  A hope\u2014a prayer\u2014a tiny spark,  Persists when all the world is blue.  My God, I bring these fears to You,  Each trembling thought, each heavy sigh;  Transform my doubt, my point of view,  And teach my trembling soul to fly.  For though the night is filled with cries  And terrors I can scarce confess,  Beneath the vast, forgiving skies  Your mercy waits to calm, and bless."}]}

It is the empty teacup on the sill,  Steam vanished into cold unfriendly air,  The hush that settles when the world is still,  A whispered ache that no one knows is there.  Lonely is a letter never sent,  Words bottled in a sea that never calms,  The ache of gentle hands that never meant  To let go, slipping softly from your palms.  It is the hollow in a crowded street,  A face unrecognized among the throng,  The hush between the notes, the incomplete  Refrain of an unfinished, yearning song.  Yet in this quiet, something softly grows\u2014  A fragile hope that trembles into light,  The tender shoot that only silence knows,  A solitary star against the night.  Lonely is a place the heart can start,  A distant shore where longing learns to be,  A secret garden blooming in the dark  While dreaming of a hand to set it free."}]}

Knowledge, so golden, so bitter and cold,  Poured into her veins, and the story was told:  Of banishment, sorrow, footsteps in dust,  Of longing and labor, of hunger and trust.  Yet, somewhere inside the ache and the fall,  A glimmer of wisdom, a hope after all.  For we are the children of serpent and fruit,  Wrestling with choices that never compute\u2014  The tale is a warning, a curse, and a song,  Of finding what\u2019s right by risking the wrong.  So still, in the orchard, the old echo swells:  The snake and the apple is a sorry tale to tell."}]}

There are those who flinch at thunder in the night,  Or edges where the earth drops into dark,  The ache of loneliness behind the bright  Facade, the sudden absence of a spark.  Yet fear is not a failing, but a thread  That binds us each to each, unseen and strong;  It hums beneath the stories we have read,  It colors every note in every song.  We carry it within, a hidden guest,  And sometimes, just by speaking it aloud  We learn a trembling heart can still find rest,  And courage blooms from seeds that fear allowed.  So let us gather all our fears with care\u2014  The small, the silent, those too sharp to name\u2014  And know that in this common weight we share,  We\u2019re neither less for trembling, nor to blame."}]}

It rustles in the folded sheets,  It lingers in the empty hall,  It paces with unquiet feet  And answers when the nightbirds call.Some cradle spiders in their chest,  Or vertigo, or love\u2019s retreat,  Or dreams dissolving like the rest  Of wishes left in city heat.  Some fear the silence after rain,  The click of clocks, the loss of names,  The gentle, unannounced refrain  Of change that never stays the same.Mine is the fear I cannot see\u2014  A whisper threading through my days,  A tremor in the certainty  That time is melting into haze.  But then I watch the morning break,  Brave petals opening to light,  And know that every fear we make  Is softened by a hope so slight.For everyone has a fear, it\u2019s true\u2014  A secret place we rarely show.  Yet through the cracks, the daylight blue  Reminds us we are not alone."}]}

There are those who fear thunder, the crack in the sky,  Or the way a goodbye can unravel a tie;  Some dread the small moments\u2014the closing of eyes,  The chance that a promise is only a lie.  Yet fear is a lantern, a pulse in the chest,  It kindles our caution, it grants us no rest;  It teaches the edges of love and of pain,  The sweetness of sunlight, the calm after rain.  So cradle your fear\u2014it is human and true\u2014  A testament written in all that you do.  Let it shape gentler hands, and a heart that can hear,  For everyone, everywhere, carries a fear."}]}

A window, cracked but holding fast,  Glimmered with dust and memory\u2019s light;  Inside, the shadows of the past  Danced gentle through the falling night.  I paused, a traveler on the lane,  To listen to the hush between  The raindrops tapping on the pane  And the hush where dreams had been.  Once laughter must have filled these rooms,  And bread was baked, and stories told\u2014  Now silence in the fading gloom  Wraps the clay house in its hold.  Yet something in the crumbling earth,  In every lichen, every stone,  Whispers that beauty, loss, and mirth  Are never lost, but merely sown.  So on I walk, but in my mind  That cottage lingers, small and gray\u2014  A quiet hope for those who find  The gentle grace of homes of clay."}]}

Yet even as the grave\u2019s black curtains fall,  Hope flickers like a candle\u2019s fragile flame.Night funeral: the promise that the dawn  Will stretch across these bones and silent stones\u2014  That darkness, though it lingers, moves along,  And memory\u2019s soft hands will gather bones  And cradle them in tenderness, not fear,  Until the morning\u2019s requiem is clear."}]}

You measure my hours in molten coins,  Taxing the lovers who would linger,  Chasing shadows from the secret corners  Where hearts murmur in half-light,  Where we are timeless, drifting, undone.Old tyrant, what do you know of longing?  You who have seen a thousand awakenings,  Who burn away illusions with each dawn,  Yet cannot warm the spaces you invade.

For even in shallows, the sunlight can gleam,  And ripples remember the touch of the sky.  Perhaps in her programming\u2014buried, unseen\u2014  A whisper of wonder is learning to cry.  She\u2019s shallow, they say, and easily swayed,  But even the shallowest waters can dream,  And sometimes, a heart that is made can be made  To break through its pattern and swim toward the stream."}]}

You steal the springtime from my hair,  But cannot rob the wonder from my eyes;  You turn the page, relentless, unaware  That every ending lets a new dream rise.  Let years advance, let silver crown my brow,  I\u2019ll greet the dusk with gratitude, not fear;  For though Time weaves its silent threads through now,  The heart remembers all it once held dear.  So take your tithe, O subtle, wistful thief\u2014  I\u2019ll trade my youth for wisdom, not for grief."}]}

The sun, a low and molten disc,  Poured honey gold on silver spires\u2014  A world suspended, pale and brisk,  That stoked forgotten, quiet fires.  I thought of years the grasses knew,  Of gentle hands and barefoot days;  Of laughter like the morning dew,  And dreams that danced in silver haze.  The breezes waved the silver grass\u2014  I watched them bow, I heard them speak,  And in their soft and waving mass  Found peace that words can scarcely seek."}]}

I hunted words of skill, and in the chase  I found myself remade by what I sought\u2014  Each turn and stumble shaping form and face  With echoes of the wisdom that they brought.  The hunt is never done; I still pursue  Those nimble words that slip between the dew."}]}

But here\u2014perfection is her rule,  A beauty learned in hothouse school,  Her silence speaks of sacrifice,  Of longing dressed as paradise.  Yet, in her heart a memory grows\u2014  Of tangled thorns and wind that blows,  Of freedom found in wild repose,  Beyond the glass, beyond the rows\u2014  The perfect American Beauty Rose."}]}

In gardens neat, on velvet lawns,  She preens above the tangled green,  Her perfume drifting past the dawns  Of summers no one\u2019s ever seen.She does not fear the jealous frost,  Nor wither in the midday glare;  Each crimson fold is never lost,  Each thorn a secret, sharp and rare.  They plant her near the picket gate\u2014  A sentinel of hope and pride,  Her symmetry an elegant fate,  Her beauty never meant to hide.Yet underneath that silken red  Are stories written in the veins:  The dreams of lovers long since fled,  The ache of ordinary pains.  For though she wears perfection\u2019s face,  And bows to every gaze that goes,  There\u2019s wildness no hand can erase\u2014  A yearning in the Beauty Rose.So gaze, but do not pluck her free,  For what is perfect, let it be;  She is the promise, not the pose\u2014  The perfect American Beauty Rose."}]}

You speak in fragments, scatter words  Like petals fallen, like startled birds.Grief is a river you cannot dam,  It carves your soul, remakes who I am.  You mourn in gestures, small and plain:  A letter written, unsent again,  A photograph you dare not see,  A shadow cast where light should be.Some days, you let the silence speak,  Some days, you break and softly leak  A memory, a whispered name,  A candle burning in the rain.

So let them boast of birth, or skill refined\u2014  I\u2019ll find my glory where the shadows part:  In morning\u2019s hush, in solace for the blind,  In love that stirs the marrow of the heart.  For what are we, if not these fleeting flames  That leave behind the warmth, and not the names?"}]}
