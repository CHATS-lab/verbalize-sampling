I watched the world from distant glass,  A window smeared by dreams and rain,  The days paraded, slow to pass,  And every joy was tinged with pain.  The games, the shouts, the easy trust  Were foreign lands I could not claim;  I held my secrets, tight as dust,  And wore my difference like a name.  The moon would whisper me awake  While others slept in gentle peace;  And every dawn, the ache would slake  But never fully grant release.  Yet in the silence, wild and deep,  I learned the language of the trees,  The hush where ancient sorrows sleep,  The comfort of the restless breeze.  So though I walk a path apart,  Not woven with the common thread,  Within my solitary heart  A thousand worlds are softly spread."}]}

And so, though fears may never cease,  I gather courage from the day,  And rise, uncertain but in peace,  To walk the path You light my way."}]}

The stars crowd the heavens, immense and unbound,  Their light spilling secrets on dust-hallowed ground,  While the moon stirs the dreams of the men who have known  The taste of the distance, the ache of alone.Yet out in this silence, a heartbeat persists,  In the ring of an axe, in the morning\u2019s pale mist,  For hope is a candle, and life is a quest  On a lonely selection far out in the West."}]}

Here, the magpies remember the songs of the dawn,  And the kangaroo\u2019s shadow drifts soft through the grass,  And the creek, though it falters, still stammers at morn  Of the rains and the floods that would thunder and pass.  It is lonely, this corner, with distance for kin,  Where the sun\u2019s fierce caress and the frost\u2019s icy breath  Are companions more constant than laughter or din\u2014  Yet a heart finds its measure in silence, not death.  For the stars spill their stories on corrugated iron,  And the moon sketches secrets on wide, empty land;  On a lonely selection, far out and forgotten,  Still hope plants its flag in the red, restless sand."}]}

A kettle sings comfort to one weathered hand,  While the other draws dreams in the ochre red sand.  Letterbox empty, but hope lingers yet\u2014  A wild, stubborn promise too proud to forget.  On a lonely selection far out in the West,  Each morning is born with the same silent quest:  To gather the solace of wide, open sky,  And live in the stillness where legends won\u2019t die."}]}

It whispers when the lights go out,  And lingers at the edge of day\u2014  A question mark, a thread of doubt,  A hope we fear may slip away.  But though we cower, close and tight,  Or armor up with jokes and cheer,  We\u2019re braver for the things we fight:  To walk beside our trembling fear.  For in the sharing, fear grows thin\u2014  A story offered, softly heard.  We find the strength to let light in,  And fear, at last, becomes a word."}]}

A collage of faces and gestures,  a mosaic of sorrow and mirth,  each encounter a fragment  of the story we\u2019re worth.And when twilight gathers around us,  we remember not the years,  but the warmth in a stranger\u2019s laughter,  the salt of remembered tears.  For in the mingling of footsteps  on this ever-turning road,  we find pieces of ourselves  in every soul we\u2019ve known."}]}

The moon, a silent guardian, would keep  Her watch above my softly rising chest,  And every wish I\u2019d whispered into sleep  Was gathered gently, carried to her nest.  In my first sleep, before the world returned,  I dreamt of rivers no one else could see,  Of lessons that my waking mind unlearned,  Of places that were waiting just for me.  There, shadows never threatened, only played,  And every fear dissolved into the deep;  I rested in the innocence I made  Within the quiet grace of my first sleep."}]}

We are half-rooted in the wonder, half-lost in the blunder  Of searching for our meaning in the flight of distant birds.We are dreamy creature, soft-edged and undefined,  We gather up the shimmer where the waking worlds collide.  With every breath, we wander through the hallways of the mind,  Carrying the hope that dreams are never set aside.So let us drift together, as dusk leans into night,  And hold the dream within us, gentle, fierce, and bright."}]}

Yet petals bruise as seasons pass,  Her blush reflected in the glass\u2014  A fleeting vision, bold and true:  Perfection costs what\u2019s lost from view.Still, in the dusk, she bows her head,  Recalling words once left unsaid,  And dreams of freedom, soft and close,  Beyond the myth, beyond the rose."}]}

Some say grief is a language  of unspoken words,  a tide that pulls you under,  leaving salt on your lips and the taste of longing.

To express loss is to plant seeds in winter\u2014  you write letters that will never be answered,  sing lullabies to the night,  let tears fall into the soil  in hope that something green might grow.  You grieve by carrying their laughter in your pocket,  by lighting candles in the dusk,  by speaking their name to the wind,  until the ache becomes a quiet companion,  and the world, changed,  is still somehow whole."}]}

As quietly as dew vanishes at dawn,  Or as thunder echoing in an empty house\u2014  In the hush between heartbeats,  Where absence finds its voice.You can grieve in the way a willow bends,  Its slender arms trailing in water,  Not breaking, but remembering each storm.  You can grieve in the scatter of old letters,  Ink blurred by thumbprints,  Or in the slow, unhurried folding  Of a sweater no longer worn.Sometimes loss is a stone in the mouth,  Unswallowed, heavy and smooth,  Or a song that stumbles  On the chord you both loved.  It can be a name held like a secret,  Or spoken aloud to the wind.To express loss is to let sunlight  Fall on the empty chair,  To cup the memory and lift it, trembling,  Into the morning air.  It is to plant seeds, knowing  Some will not blossom\u2014  Yet pressing them gently  Into the earth all the same.How can you grieve and express loss?  With tenderness, and time\u2014  With the courage to remember,  And the grace to let go."}]}

Loss is the echo that answers,  Softly, when you call out in the dark\u2014  Not gone, but changed,  A presence woven into absence,  A love that endures the letting go."}]}

Their dreams were not for riches,  but for seasons to come and go gently,  for children\u2019s laughter to echo  in the hollow of old apple trees.At dusk, they gathered on wooden porches,  watching fireflies blink open  in the soft arms of summer.  They were indeed simple people\u2014  and in their simple living,  they carved out quiet, lasting places  where the heart could rest,  and where the world was, for a time, enough."}]}

Yet sometimes in the dusk\u2019s retreat  A child lifts eyes to sapphire skies,  And in that gaze, the worlds all meet\u2014  The lost, the longing, and the wise.  O let the seekers rise once more,  With open hands and lifted face;  For truth, though silent at its core,  Still waits in every cloud\u2019s embrace.  As less on earth seek truth above,  May one small voice ignite the night\u2014  Reminding us, through doubt and love,  To look for stars beyond our sight."}]}

The silver cradle glimmers in the dawn,  Its lullabies a legacy unearned;  Yet somewhere, hands grown callused, spirit drawn,  A quiet fire within the labor churned.  Some gather praise as autumn gathers leaves,  A bounty for the lineage they possess;  While others, like the stubborn root, believe  In rising through the frost, despite duress.  The sun regards them both with equal flame\u2014  No gilded tongue, no weathered palm denied.  For glory wears a thousand shapes and names,  And finds its home where pride and hope reside.  So let the trumpet blare for noble blood,  Let laurels rest on those who master art\u2014  But envy not the river nor the flood;  The mountain, too, is noble from the start.  And in the hush, beyond both praise and birth,  A life well-lived is glory\u2019s truest worth."}]}

And when at last I saw you, where the water met the sky,  I knew the journey\u2019s sorrow had taught my soul to fly.For the river, wild and faithful, had carried me all along\u2014  Its music in my footsteps, its strength within my song."}]}
