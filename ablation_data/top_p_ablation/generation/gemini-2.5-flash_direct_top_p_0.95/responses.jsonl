Walls grow taller, day by day,Reflecting back the light I cannot sway.The laughter distant, like a fading dream,A joyful current, flowing in a streamI watch from shore, untouched by its embrace.Each passing shadow leaves a vacant traceOf what might be, of what could still unfold.A story whispered, never to be toldTo listening ears, or eyes that understand.A solitary castle, built on shifting sand.The stars above, a million, glittering eyes,Look down on one beneath these silent skies.No hand to hold, no voice to break the spell,Just empty rooms where lonely spirits dwell.A quiet ache, a yearning deep inside,Where hidden hopes and broken dreams reside.And in that quiet, a profound despair,A single breath, exhaled into the air."}]}

A glint in Stalky's eye,A knowing smirk as Beetle ambled by,And McTurk, the muscle, ready for the chase,A trio bound by time, and by this place.No noble quest, but battles of the wit,Against the system, where they wouldn't sitIn quiet awe. The prefects, pompous, proud,Would soon be humbled by the laughing crowdOf boys who knew the cracks within the rule,And made a mockery of the dreary school.So let the prelude sound, a bugle call,To pranks and scrapes, to standing strong and tallAgainst the giants of the academic sphere.For in these pages, laughter conquers fear,And boyhood's spirit, wild and unconfined,A truer education, you will find."}]}
