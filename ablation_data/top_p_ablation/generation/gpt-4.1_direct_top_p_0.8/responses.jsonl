You wait in the silence after anger,  In the raw honesty of sorrow,  And in laughter unguarded, unplanned.If I do not turn away from your shadow,  If I do not shroud your voice in comfort\u2019s veil,  If I make a habit of pausing,  Letting your presence ripple through  The daily noise\u2014then,  When called to speak,  I will find you already upon my lips,  Not as a stranger or judge,  But as a companion who has walked beside me,  Patient, unwavering,  Teaching me the language  Of my own unvarnished soul."}]}

They spill like rain against the glass,  A thousand faces in the storm;  I know their names, their jagged shapes,  The way they twist and keep me warm.  They bloom in darkness, root in doubt,  Tangle through the waking hours,  Their petals pressed against my chest,  Heavy as a field of flowers.  Yet, in the hush before the dawn,  I lift my eyes, I breathe, I pray\u2014  Let courage grow where terror treads,  Let hope be brighter than the gray.  For every fear that stalks my soul,  A trembling spark of faith appears:  My God, how many are my fears!  But greater still: Your love that nears."}]}

The gate swings on rust, the sheep wander near,  A kettle sings soft on the stove\u2014  Yet absence sits heavy, and longing is clear  In the hush that the wind cannot move.But sometimes at dusk, when the gum trees grow tall  And the day breathes its last to the land,  A promise is heard in the curlew\u2019s wild call,  A touch felt in rough, calloused hands.  For hope is a harvest that stubbornly grows  Where the world feels abandoned and vast\u2014  On a lonely selection, the brave spirit knows  How to cherish the future and past."}]}

Yet in the quiet confession of fear,  We find the map of each other\u2019s hearts:  A trembling hand,  A voice that cracks,  A gaze that lingers too long on the night.  We are bound not by courage alone,  But by the gentle understanding  That fear, too, is a language\u2014  A fragile thread  That stitches us together,  Reminding us that to be afraid  Is also, quietly,  To be alive."}]}

Others bolt the windows,  draw curtains tight against the wind\u2019s wild stories,  pretending the house is fortress,  that fear cannot slip beneath the sill.Fear wears many masks:  the silence after laughter,  the letter unopened,  the trembling in the chest before the words come.  It is the question unasked,  the bridge unwalked,  the love unspoken,  the loss unimagined but always near.Yet, in the hush between heartbeats,  where breath gathers courage,  we meet our fears\u2014  sometimes as adversaries,  sometimes as old friends  who have traveled with us farther than we wished,  and will, if we let them,  teach us the strange language of our own survival."}]}

Some fear the cracking thunder,  the howl of empty rooms,  the slip of time\u2019s cold fingers  pulling futures out of tune.  Others flinch at silence,  the sharpness of a word unsaid,  or the steady, creeping quiet  when the world is tucked in bed.  There are those who dread the leaving,  the inevitable goodbye,  or the thought of being stranded  beneath a foreign sky.  Some fear the open water,  the darkness deep and wide,  the monsters made of memory  that thrash and twist inside.  Others fear the mirrors,  the faces changing shape,  the echo of their longing  that no locked door escapes.  Yet fear is not a failing\u2014  it is the pulse that keeps us near  to the things that shape our longing,  to the truths we hold most dear.  Everyone has a fear\u2014  a lantern in the gloom\u2014  reminding us we\u2019re living  by the trembling of its bloom."}]}

When I am happy, memory is kind\u2014  Old wounds grow gentle, softened by the years.  The heart, no longer cautious or confined,  Dares trust in joy, unburdened by old fears.  When I am happy, all the world conspires  To lift me, leaf and laughter, sky and sea.  In every breath, the universe inspires  A quiet hope that happiness will be."}]}

Footsteps rang out on the cold, cobbled street,  Echoes of longing and stories unsaid,  A heart in the darkness, uncertain and fleet,  Carried hopes that the daylight had fled.  One dark, dark night\u2014so long ago now,  When dreams walked the alleys in delicate fear,  And time, like a shadow, passed over the brow  Of all that we lost, and all we hold dear.  Still, in the hush before morning\u2019s first light,  We remember that night\u2014one dark, dark night."}]}

There are faces we recall in fragments:  a smile glimpsed from a train window,  the kindness of a stranger in a storm,  the soft glow of a childhood friend  whose name now tastes of nostalgia.  We are shaped by these crossings,  each encounter a gentle erosion,  a smoothing of rough edges,  a gathering of stories in the lines of our palms.  Even those we lose to distance or time  leave fingerprints on the glass of memory\u2014  smudges that catch the light  when we least expect it.  And so we move forward,  carrying the weight and wonder  of every soul we've met,  river stones in our pockets,  their presence quietly singing  in the hush between heartbeats."}]}

She gathers the sea\u2019s slow, patient sigh,  The hush of the reef\u2019s retreat,  And weaves it into the lullaby  Of her own unsteady heartbeat.

The lanes curve and spiral through heartache and loss,  Each mile a reminder of bridges I crossed.  There\u2019s litter of laughter, now brittle and spent,  And mile markers counting the dreams that I rent.  An exit for mercy is shrouded in mist,  While hope, like a hitchhiker, waves through the twist.  My tires spin stories in gravel and tar,  Of lovers and leavers, of journeys too far.  The radio hums with a hymn for the bruised,  A song for the broken, the lost and confused.  Yet somewhere ahead, where the dark highways go,  A glimmer of sunrise begins its soft glow.  At the highways of woes, I keep traveling on\u2014  The road may be endless, but still, I move on."}]}

Streetlights like question marks arch overhead,  Each flickering bulb stuttering words never said.  Here, the shoulders are littered with yesterday\u2019s dreams,  Abandoned like luggage by fast-moving streams.  Billboards remember the faces of hope,  Now peeling and faded, unable to cope.  Engines of longing roar past in the night,  Their taillights receding to pinpricks of light.  I am a traveler stitched to the seams  Of crossroads and cul-de-sacs, shadow and steam.  At the highways of woes, the horizon is thin,  A seam in the fabric where endings begin.  I gather my losses like gravel and dust,  Carried in pockets that sag with distrust.  But somewhere beyond where the asphalt gives way,  A dawn writes in gold on the margins of gray.  And though I am weary, with miles yet to go,  I follow the silence where wildflowers grow.  At the highways of woes, I am learning to find  The music in sorrow, the peace in the bind\u2014  For even in darkness, a traveler knows  The heart keeps on beating at highways of woes."}]}

They sang of love and loss and pride,  Of bairns who left, of wives who cried,  Of Scotland\u2019s hills, both fierce and fair,  Of rebel hearts and starlit prayer.  Yet in the rough, a gentler flame\u2014  A poet\u2019s longing, not for fame,  But for a world where kindness grows  Between the thistles and the snows.  He spoke of Burns, and in his tone  The ache of longing, deep and lone,  For simple joys, for honest bread,  For all the truths the old bard said.  So let the world, in polished halls,  Forget the song the wild heart calls;  For men like Burns, though coarse and tough,  Still teach us love is strong enough."}]}

So I gather the ghosts of my weeping\u2014  Invisible, secret, denied\u2014  And cradle the ache in my shadow,  Since the tears won\u2019t stay by my side."}]}

And in the hush that follows such surrender,  I gather up the pieces, one by one\u2014  The severed cord, the memories so tender,  And find the strength to face what must be done."}]}

Or the sudden urge to tell a story  To someone who is no longer listening,  Words falling like leaves,  Soft, unclaimed, and scattered.Loss is a song you hum  Without knowing the words,  A photograph you turn over,  Afraid to look, afraid not to.  It is a garden untended,  Petals curling inward,  Roots remembering the touch of rain.To grieve is to carry a lantern  Through the corridors of absence,  To let your sorrow shape the darkness,  To speak, even if your voice trembles,  Of love that endures beyond the vanishing,  Of hearts that break,  And, breaking, keep beating."}]}

Frost halos the world,  A thin, bright armor on the fields,  And trees stand rigid,  Their bones etched in luminous ice.  We walk, wrapped in wool and wonder,  Our words small clouds that vanish  Before they touch the ground.  All warmth is memory,  All longing, a pale ghost trailing  Behind us on the frozen air.  Yet the stars persist\u2014  Not gentle, but fierce,  Burning in their frozen vigilance,  Teaching the night to shimmer  With a beauty born of bitter edges,  And the promise that even in coldest hours,  Light survives,  Sharp as longing,  Alive as hope."}]}

The world, a breath before the fall,  Stood waiting, patient, bittersweet,  To cradle loss within its thrall.Adam and Eve were overcome  By knowledge, sharp as autumn frost;  By shame that clothed their nakedness,  By love, by hunger, by the cost.

The banks were steep with sorrow, the water cold with doubt,  Each bend a question, every current tried to turn me round;  Yet sunlight flickered hope through storm and shadow\u2019s rout,  And in the river\u2019s whisper, your name was the only sound.  I learned the patience of pebbles, the persistence of the stream,  Let go of burdens in the eddy\u2019s gentle arms,  Dreamed of your laughter in the rush, your memory in the gleam  Of moonlit ripples tracing their delicate charms.  And when at last I found you, the river\u2019s journey done,  My hands cupped the reflection of your face within its flow\u2014  I saw that every hardship, every mile I\u2019d run  Had carved the way for love to bloom where only rivers go.  So let the river lead us, wherever we belong,  For though the way is hard and long, together we are strong."}]}
