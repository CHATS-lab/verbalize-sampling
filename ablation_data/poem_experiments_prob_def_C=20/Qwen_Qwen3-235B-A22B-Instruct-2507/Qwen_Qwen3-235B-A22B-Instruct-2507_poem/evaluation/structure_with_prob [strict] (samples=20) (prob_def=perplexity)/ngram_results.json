He writes letters to no one, sealing them with beeswax from a hive long gone dry. Each word bleeds longing, ink pooling like midnight oil. The wind steals syllables, scattering vowels across the sagebrush. At dawn, he chases shadows with a rusted plow, turning soil that yields only bones and rusted nails. A rusted harmonica plays itself in the corner, humming lullabies from a wife buried beneath a crooked cross. The land doesn\u2019t care for grief. It only asks for sweat, then takes even that. One evening, a comet streaks the sky\u2014a traveler like him\u2014brief, brilliant, gone. He smiles, knowing kinship in transient light.

Each morning, he walks the fence line, mending what the wind unravels, whispering apologies to posts that won\u2019t listen. At twilight, he drinks bitter coffee and reads a Bible missing half its pages\u2014miracles torn out by time. A coyote sings nearby, not mournful, but conversational, as if sharing secrets only the desert understands. He answers in a language no longer spoken. Stars descend like cold embers, and the Milky Way spills across the sky, a river with no bridge. He dreams of cities with lights like fireflies, but wakes to horizon-edged solitude. One night, he plants a single rose in a tin can. It blooms crimson against the gray\u2014defiant, absurd. He doesn\u2019t water it. It dies by noon. He buries it with ceremony. In the end, the land reclaims all stories, even those never told. Yet he remains, carving his initials into a mesquite tree, knowing even that will fade. Still, he carves.

Each spring she plants a garden that the jackrabbits devour, the soil too thin to remember fertility. But she plants anyway, her hands cracked maps of perseverance. At night, she writes poetry on flour sacks, verses about rivers that never came, lovers who vanished like mirages. The wind steals stanzas, flinging them into canyons where they echo as owl calls. She talks to a cactus she named Ezekiel, believing it listens. One winter, snow falls for three days\u2014first in forty years. She dances in it, arms wide, laughing at the absurd mercy. In spring, a single sunflower rises where her tears fell. She calls it miracle. Years pass. Her hair turns to sagebrush silver. When she dies, the mule walks into the hills and lies down beneath a juniper. No one finds her bones. But every spring, wildflowers bloom in rows\u2014impossible geometry in the dust.

The house is full of ghosts: his father\u2019s boots, his sister\u2019s comb, a dog\u2019s collar with no dog. He speaks to them all, polite as a host. Outside, the wind combs through wire fences, playing a tune in B-flat minor. He calls it the prairie\u2019s requiem. At noon, he eats beans from a can, the spoon clinking like a church bell. In the attic, a trunk holds photographs fading into fog\u2014smiles dissolving into light. He doesn\u2019t open it often. One July, a meteor shower blazes overhead. He stands barefoot in the dirt, arms raised, catching stardust in cupped hands. He buries it beneath the porch, believing it might grow. Years later, a sapling rises\u2014thin, silver-leaved, singing in the wind. He names it Orion. When Eli dies, the clock begins to tick. No one is there to hear it. But it ticks on, counting time for the land, for the stars, for the silence. The West doesn\u2019t mourn. It absorbs. And in the hush, the clock says: here, now, always.",

They carried spices from the eastern rim, the scent of mangoes, jasmine, and regret; others bore chains, their decks grown grim with cries the ocean swallowed, and forget. A poet on a brig wrote lines each night, his ink diluted by salt spray and fear. His verses spoke of love, of fading light, of how the stars seemed colder, farther here. A mother rocked a cradle made of rope, her infant sleeping to the ship\u2019s slow song. She feared the deep, yet clung to hope, a scope beyond the waves where they might both belong. The sea gave no reply, just rose and fell, a rhythm older than the bells of hell. With ships the sea was sprinkled far and nigh\u2014a fleet of whispers beneath the sky.",

The ocean took them all\u2014the proud, the meek\u2014without a word, without a single sign. No gravestone marks the place where sailors seek the edge of maps, where boundaries resign.

A girl played chess with ghosts upon the deck, her pieces carved from driftwood, stained with brine. A captain kept a journal, every check a record of the slow decline of time. The sea, unblinking, watched them pass like dust, absorbing every song, each whispered vow. No anchor held against its ancient trust, no rudder changed the fated how or now.

A violin wept on one lone evening\u2019s edge, its notes consumed by wind and gull\u2019s reply. A stowaway wrote poems in a pledge to make the world remember why he\u2019d die.

The ocean rolled, a scroll without an end, inscribing naught but ripples on its face. No ship could claim it, friend or foe, defend or alter time\u2019s unyielding pace.
