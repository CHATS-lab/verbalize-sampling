Sun-drunken roses lean heavy and bright,  Their fragrance a promise that drifts out of sight.

A season suspended, both fragile and strong\u2014  The echo of sunlight, the hush of a song.

Sunrise is sharper, a spear through the haze,  Painting the dam in a copper-lit blaze.  Loneliness gathers in shadows that creep  From the half-fallen hay shed to sheep huddled deep.  A single white mailbox, the paint flaked away,  Waits for a letter that\u2019s always delayed.  The gumtrees stand sentinel, twisted and gaunt,  Echoes of stories, of hunger and haunt.  The laughter of children has thinned in the air,  Replaced by the whip-bird and dust devils\u2019 dare.  Yet hope is a habit\u2014persistent, unbowed\u2014  Sprouting like wild oats through soil unploughed.  So under the brilliance of unbroken blue,  A figure stands watching horizons anew,  Dreaming of thunder, of rain\u2019s blessed guest,  On a lonely selection far out in the West.",

The stars gather boldly, unhidden by light,  And dreams drift as freely as moths in the night.  On a lonely selection, far out and unseen,  Still pulses the promise of what might have been.",

For here in the silence, the heart learns to mend,  And the pulse of the land is both stranger and friend.  Each dawn is a promise, each dusk is a prayer,  For rain, for a letter, for someone to care.  Yet love finds a foothold in saplings and stone,  In the tracks of a lizard, the seeds that are sown.

Eve\u2019s hand is slow and trembling, her eyes a tide of sky,  She tastes the core of mystery, the sweetness and the lie.  A universe comes tumbling, the stars collapse like tears\u2014  A single, fateful moment unfurls a thousand years.  But oh, the tale keeps turning, and gardens fall away,  Yet apples still are bitten in wonder and dismay.  In every human longing, in every thirst we chase,  The snake and apple linger\u2014our shadow and our grace.  So tell the sorry story, as old as fear and fire:  To hunger is to suffer, but to reach is to aspire.",

A spindle, a spool, an old kettle at rest,  Echoed the hush of the dust,  While wind wove a song in the walls\u2019 earthen chest,  And the beams bore the weight of their trust.I stood in the hush, where the past softly clings,  Feeling life\u2019s circle turn slow\u2014  The cottage of clay, with its sorrow and wings,  Held beauty the world may not know.

Her eyes are bright as rivers run,  Reflecting sky and setting sun,  Her voice a bell in morning air,  She scatters crumbs with gentle care.  She sweeps the porch with willow broom,  The dawn\u2019s sweet promise in each room,  She kneads the dough with flour-dust hands,  And hums a tune of distant lands.  Her heart is stitched to furrowed rows,  To seedling hope and what she grows,  Yet in her smile, there lives the gleam  Of childhood\u2019s wish and woman\u2019s dream.  When storms descend with thunder\u2019s drum,  She gathers lambs, she will not run,  Her laughter, clear against the gray,  Outshines the gloom and bids it stay.  A farmer\u2019s wife, both young and gay,  She harvests joy from every day\u2014  In fields of gold or skies of blue,  Her spirit sows the world anew.",

So onward I travel, with courage to steer,  Through highways of woes, till the sunrise is near\u2014  For each weary journey, each sorrow I brave,  Brings me closer to joy at the bend of the grave.",

Yet, even hidden, hope begins to grow\u2014  A tiny ember warming in her chest.  She listens as a distant thrush, aglow,  Sings light into the fabric of her rest.  For hiding is not vanishing, but pause;  A gathering of strength within the shell.  She breathes, she waits, and when the silence thaws,  She\u2019ll step from shade and wear her story well.",

Morning brought promise in the shape of clouds,  even as the earth beneath us cracked its lips in thirst.But born in the famine struck Africa,  I found inheritance in the sweep of starlit plains,  in the rhythm of drums that echoed through want.  My bones are carved from endurance,  my spirit stitched from the golden threads  of sunflowers blooming in impossible places\u2014  proof that life insists, always, on breaking through.",

They measured fortune in pebbles\u2014  A smooth one from the river,  A blue one found on a walk\u2014  And spent their riches on time:  Long afternoons beneath the willow,  Chores shared, burdens halved,  A look across the supper table  That said all words left unsaid.  When storms swept the valley,  They stood in the doorway,  Shoulder to shoulder,  Unfazed by thunder,  Rooted like oaks\u2014  Simple, yes,  But strong as the land  That cradled their hope.",

Her beauty is not borrowed, not conjured,  But rooted in the garden she tends within herself,  Where dreams grow wild among the weeds,  And laughter rings out, clear and true.  Cinderella is the moment you recognize yourself  In the mirror, not for what you wear,  But for the gentle light blooming from your soul,  A radiance spun from days untouched by magic\u2014  The beauty of a heart steadfast,  The personality of hope that endures.",

I lingered there with a wistful heart,  Touched by the peace of what had been,  Wishing, perhaps, I could impart  The warmth of memory pressed within\u2014  A world entire, set gently apart.  The cottage dreams in its coat of clay,  A monument to the quiet and small;  In frail decay it holds at bay  The rush of years, the world\u2019s loud call\u2014  A haven for souls who lose their way.",

Inside, the silence is soft as a prayer,  Dancing with motes in the amber-lit air.  A kettle forgotten on embers long cold,  Echoes of stories that never were told.
