This minute.A square of pale light, framed by doubt,where yesterday\u2019s ghost still lingered in it,and tomorrow\u2019s promise felt shut out.But no, not shut. Just waiting, perhaps,for the sun to finally break through the grey,to paint the sill with a thousand new maps,unfurling the promise of a brand new day.This minute, the world outside is a blur,a symphony of whispers, a silent hum.A robin, a car, a distant whir,each note a promise of what\u2019s to come.And I, within this quiet space,a witness to the shifting light,can feel the rhythm of time\u2019s embrace,unfolding patterns, day and night.This minute, the dust motes dance and gleam,illuminated by a sudden ray.A fleeting glimpse of a waking dream,before the moment slips away.But it won\u2019t slip. It\u2019s held, contained,within the frame of glass and wood.A truth unspoken, unreigned,a moment perfectly understood.That\u2019s my window. This minute.A canvas bare, a story untold.And I, the artist, standing in it,ready to make this moment gold.",
