From dust and sorrow, a fragile life takes hold, a story whispered, brave and yet untold. \n\nNo lullabies of plenty, no soft, full breast, only the gnawing ache, putting strength to the test. But in the depths of hardship, a spirit takes its flight, a will to overcome, a beacon in the night. \n\nFor every grain of sand, a tear that's gently shed, a silent promise made, to rise above the dread. The sun may scorch, the well may run dry, but hope, a tiny ember, refuses to die. A future painted, not by hunger's cruel hand, but by the fierce resolve of a determined land.",
