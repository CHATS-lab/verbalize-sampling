Overcome by a profound, aching loneliness, a chasm opened between them where once there was seamless connection. The taste of the fruit, cloying and sweet on their tongues, turned bitter with the understanding of what they had lost. Their simple joy, their unburdened existence, was overcome by the crushing weight of knowledge and the terrifying freedom of choice.
