In the midnight hours, beneath the humming neon of the old city, I drew energy from the electric pulse of forgotten alleyways. My fingers tingled, sparks flickering along my skin as I rewrote the circuitry of the world around me. With a single thought, streetlights danced and radios played secret songs. But the power that once set me free became a tether, binding me to the city's endless hunger. I watched, through fractured reflections in puddles, as my own image faded with each surge. One night, I met a girl painting constellations on the sidewalk. She smiled, unafraid, and handed me a brush. For the first time, I chose to create rather than control. The city pulsed softer, gentler, and I realized true power was not in command, but in connection.", "index": 4}]}

The moment the two parallel universes brushed against each other, an idea leapt from one reality to the next. In the world where birds spoke and humans listened, a small girl named Lyra heard a raven whisper her name at sunrise. In our world, at the exact same moment, a boy named Eliot woke to the sound of a crow cawing outside his window. Unbeknownst to them, their thoughts began to overlap. Lyra dreamed of skyscrapers, Eliot imagined talking birds. As the days passed, the boundary between their worlds thinned, and one night, Lyra and Eliot both found themselves standing in a field lit by two moons. They recognized each other instantly, though they had never met. Holding hands, they walked toward the horizon, ready to discover what else was more than possible.", "index": 1}]}

We ducked down an alley, through a door, up creaking stairs. Inside, a cat perched on a pile of books. He sat, poured two glasses of something strong, and began: \u201cAsk.

The editor\u2019s faith in Urueta\u2019s penchant for storytelling was, in my view, misplaced. He\u2019d dodged me for weeks, slipping out back doors and leaving cryptic voicemails.

We\u2019d been staking out the hotel lobby for hours, hiding behind potted ferns as Urueta wove through throngs of delegates, a silk scarf trailing behind him like a comet\u2019s tail.
