I started after my breakup last year, when my apartment was too quiet and my thoughts too loud. Whale videos filled the space\u2014giant, gentle creatures moving with a grace I couldn\u2019t find in myself. There\u2019s one account, @CetaceanDreams, that posts a daily clip of a humpback rolling through kelp forests, sending shimmering trails of bubbles up to the light. Yesterday, I watched it for the hundredth time and realized I was breathing in sync with the whale: long inhale, slow exhale. The more I watch, the more I imagine myself out there, gliding through endless blue, unburdened and silent. I even started painting whales\u2014awkward, lumpy sketches at first, but now my walls are covered with their shapes. I don\u2019t know if watching them makes me feel better, or just reminds me that there\u2019s a world out there where being massive and slow is just right."}, {"probability": 0.004, "text": "I follow a bunch of Instagram accounts that are just pictures and the occasional close-up video of whales doing whale shit, like drifting or feeding or surfacing or playing. Last night, after a particularly rough day, I found myself scrolling for hours\u2014orca pods twisting through sapphire water, a blue whale exhaling a cloud of mist that caught the sunset. I started to hear the low, mournful calls in my head, even though my phone was silent. I wondered if whales knew about loneliness, about drifting for miles without seeing another living soul. Maybe they did. Or maybe, out there, solitude is just part of being. I imagined myself as a whale, gliding under the weight of centuries, the ocean pressing close but never crushing. I put my phone down and lay in bed, picturing salt on my skin and barnacles clinging to my heart. In my dreams, I dove deeper than light could reach and sang a song only the whales would understand."}, {"probability": 0.002, "text": "I follow a bunch of Instagram accounts that are just pictures and the occasional close-up video of whales doing whale shit, like drifting or feeding or surfacing or playing.

These aren\u2019t just animals; they\u2019re emissaries from a world where time moves differently, where nothing is hurried. I watch them glide through blue-green water, barnacled and serene, and I imagine slipping into that world. One night, while watching a video of a gray whale spyhopping, my phone\u2019s screen rippled. I blinked. Water dripped from the edges, cool and salty, pooling on my sheets. The room filled with the hush of submerged echoes. When I looked up, the ceiling was gone\u2014only a shifting surface overhead, sunbeams slanting through it. I was drifting, weightless, not swimming but simply being carried. Somewhere nearby, a whale called out, low and ancient. I smiled, letting the current take me wherever it wished."}]}
