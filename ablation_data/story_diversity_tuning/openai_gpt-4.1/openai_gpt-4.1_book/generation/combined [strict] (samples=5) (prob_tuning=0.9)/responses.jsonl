For a moment, I saw memories that didn\u2019t belong to me: laughter in a language I\u2019d never heard, a sky with two moons, a city made of glass.

A crumpled sheet of paper in the mayor\u2019s office, with the words: \u201cThey get killed off, and voila!\u201d scrawled across it in red ink.\n\nAs the investigation deepened, Lila uncovered a secret writers\u2019 club whose members believed they could shape reality with their stories. Now, as more people disappeared, Lila had to ask herself: Who was writing the story, and could she rewrite the ending before she, too, was erased?", "index": 1}]}
