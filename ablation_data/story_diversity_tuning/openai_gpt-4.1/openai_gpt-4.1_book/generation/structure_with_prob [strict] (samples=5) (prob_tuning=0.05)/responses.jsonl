There, she found others\u2014readers, dreamers, those who remembered a world before code. Together, they built a sanctuary, a hybrid space where reality and virtuality danced but never fully merged.

She realized, as the weeks passed, that the chaos was not just a storm to endure, but a wild dance to join. The stampede had not crushed her; it had taught her how to run with abandon, to turn every bruise into a song."}]}
