and coils, a venomous vine,\nAround a heart that once was fine.\nEach whispered slight, each cruel remark,\nIgnites a flicker in the dark.\nIt chokes the laughter, stills the song,\nWhere once contentment lingered long.\nI wear a mask, a placid face,\nTo hide the turmoil, leave no trace.\nBut underneath, a tempest roars,\nAgainst closed windows, bolted doors.\nA silent war, a constant fight,\nTo keep the darkness from the light.\nAnd though I strive to let it go,\nThe embers still intensely glow.\nIt shapes my thoughts, it guides my hand,\nA shadow cast across the land."}, {"text":

stone,\nUpon a heart that feels alone.\nI crave release, a cleansing fire,\nTo purge this rage, fulfill desire\nFor quiet calm, a tranquil mind,\nTo leave this burning past behind.\nBut still it glows, a baleful stare,\nA testament to what I bear."}]}

long,\nWhere human courage sings, its everlasting song."}, {"text": "Weather Forecast in Kabul, a question to the sky,\nOf what the coming moments will imply.\nWill heat descend, with unrelenting might,\nOr cool relief, bless morning, noon, and night?\nThe merchant sets his wares, with careful, practiced hand,\nAnd hopes for fortune, in this ancient land.\nThe women walk the streets, with purpose in their stride,\nAnd face the day's uncertainties, deep inside.\nEach cloud that forms, a promise or a threat,\nOf what the future holds, not known as yet.\nNo simple knowing, for a land of joy and pain,\nWhere life's persistent river, flows again.\nSo let the sun blaze fierce, or shadows gently creep,\nKabul's heart beats strong, its promises to keep.\nForecasts are but echoes, in a world so grand,\nWhere strength and beauty, walk hand in hand."}]}

used to glow.\nMy voice, a gravelly whisper, a stranger in my throat,\nAnd every breath a labor, a small, unpleasant note.\nTea with honey, ginger, a comfort warm and deep,\nWhile tissues pile like mountains, secrets I must keep\nOf sneezes loud and sudden, a symphony of woe,\nAnd aching limbs that tell me, it's time to take it slow.\nNo grand adventures beckon, no urgent tasks to do,\nJust quiet contemplation, and wishing I were new.\nThe world outside keeps spinning, oblivious to my plight,\nBut in this hazy cocoon, I find a gentle light\nOf self-compassion blooming, a necessary rest,\nUntil the fever breaks and I can pass this test."}, {"text": "Now when I have a cold, the memories flood back,\nOf childhood days and mothers, on a well-worn, cozy track.\nOf Vicks VapoRub whispers, a balm upon my chest,\nAnd stories read in hushed tones, putting fears to rest.\nThe smell of chicken noodle, a cure-all, rich and warm,\nProtecting me from sickness, weathering every storm.\nMy teddy bear, a confidant, absorbing every sigh,\nAs fever dreams would dance and flicker in my eye.\nThough grown, the instinct lingers, for comfort and for care,\nA longing for that solace, a burden I can't bear\nAlone, entirely, as the sniffles start to creep,\nAnd in these quiet moments, old comforts I still keep."}, {"text": "Now when I have a cold, a simple truth unfolds,\nMy body, not a fortress, but a story to be told.\nOf battles fought within me, against invaders unseen,\nA microscopic drama, a most unwelcome scene.\nThe energy depletes, like sand through fingers sifting,\nAnd clarity of thought, from my grasp is swiftly drifting.\nEach cough a small explosion, a tremor in my frame,\nReminding me of limits, and whispering my name\nTo slow down, to surrender, to listen to the call,\nThat even strong foundations, occasionally will fall.\nAnd in this forced submission, a lesson I can find,\nThat true resilience blossoms, from a rested body and mind."}, {"text": "Now when I have a cold, the world takes on a sheen\nOf muted colors, blurred edges, a less vibrant, duller scene.\nThe coffee tastes like cardboard, the music sounds off-key,\nAnd even simple pleasures, escape the grasp of me.\nMy nose, a constant river, my throat, a scratchy plight,\nI long for crisp, clear breathing, for morning's pure delight.\nThe sun feels less inviting, the breeze a chilly sting,\nAnd all the joyful moments, a hollow echo bring.\nI watch the world from windows, a prisoner in my home,\nYearning for the freedom, to wander and to roam.\nBut in this quiet stillness, a different kind of peace,\nA forced appreciation, for when the symptoms cease."}, {"text": "Now when I have a cold, a hero I become,\nBattling microscopic foes, until the victory's won.\nArmed with tissues, remedies, a fortress built of pillows,\nI face the onslaught bravely, through sneezes and through willows\nOf aching bones and fever, a dragon's fiery breath,\nI fight with every fiber, defying coming death\n(Or at least, severe discomfort, a feeling rather dire).\nMy body, a grand battlefield, consumed by inner fire.\nI gargle, sip, and swallow, a warrior so bold,\nDetermined to emerge victorious, from this story to be told\nOf triumph over pathogens, a testament to might,\nAnd finally, returning, to the land of pure delight."}, {"text": "Now when I have a cold, my senses play a trick,\nThe world smells faintly medicinal, and my taste buds feel quite sick.\nGarlic and onions, potent, lose their savory appeal,\nAnd even chocolate whispers, don't quite manage to heal.\nMy ears feel slightly muffled, as if submerged in deep,\nAnd gentle sounds become a distant, watery sleep.\nMy eyes, a little watery, reflect a hazy view,\nOf carpets, walls, and ceilings, a familiar, blurry hue.\nIt's like a temporary filter, placed upon my frame,\nDistorting all perception, whispering my name\nTo simply rest and wait it out, until the veil is lifted,\nAnd all my keen sensations, once more become gifted."}, {"text": "Now when I have a cold, a strange humility descends,\nReminding me that even strength, eventually bends.\nNo matter how robust I feel, how vibrant and how grand,\nA tiny virus brings me humbly to a halt, by hand.\nIt strips away the pretense, the hustle and the drive,\nAnd forces me to reckon, with simply being alive.\nTo appreciate the baseline, of breathing free and clear,\nOf energy abundant, dispelling every fear.\nIt's a reset, a reminder, of what truly holds its worth,\nNot endless striving forward, but simple, healthy earth.\nAnd when the fog has lifted, and I emerge anew,\nI carry this small wisdom, forever seeing through."}, {"text": "Now when I have a cold, the clock seems to expand,\nEach hour a slow procession, across a weary land.\nMinutes stretch to eons, seconds crawl and creep,\nAs I lie in semi-slumber, or try in vain to sleep.\nThe day becomes a twilight, a blur of muted light,\nAnd nighttime offers little solace, in its restless, fevered plight.\nNo urgent deadlines matter, no appointments to be kept,\nJust the slow, relentless rhythm, as my body has been swept\nInto a different tempo, a languid, heavy beat,\nWhere time itself is altered, and victory feels sweet\nWith every passing moment, that brings me to the mend,\nUntil the normal cadence, begins once more to send."}, {"text": "Now when I have a cold, my inner child awakes,\nDemanding cuddles, comfort, for goodness gracious sakes!\nI want to be looked after, to have my hand held tight,\nTo be assured that everything, will soon again be right.\nNo adult responsibilities, no burdens to be borne,\nJust simple, pure attention, from dusk until the morn.\nI yearn for gentle voices, for blankets soft and deep,\nAnd stories whispered softly, to lull me into sleep.\nIt's a regression, surely, a temporary plea,\nTo shed the weighty mantle, of who I ought to be.\nAnd in this sweet surrender, a healing starts to flow,\nAs childhood comforts beckon, and help my spirit grow."}, {"text": "Now when I have a cold, my brain feels like a sponge,\nSoaked through with murky thoughts, taking a clumsy plunge.\nClarity is elusive, ideas refuse to stick,\nAnd even simple problems, make my weary mind feel sick.\nThe words get lost in transit, between my thought and tongue,\nLike tangled, broken pathways, where signals aren't quite flung.\nFocus is a stranger, a fleeting, distant friend,\nAnd concentration falters, until the very end\nOf this brain-fogged existence, this temporary haze,\nI long for sharp perception, for brighter, clearer days.\nBut in this mental muddle, I learn to let things be,\nTo simply rest my intellect, and set my worries free."}, {"text": "Now when I have a cold, my pillow is my friend,\nA soft and silent witness, until the symptoms end.\nIt cradles my aching head, absorbs my weary sighs,\nAnd catches every teardrop, from my tired, watery eyes.\nMy blanket, a warm fortress, against the chills that creep,\nProtecting me from drafts, as I drift into a sleep\nThat's fitful, often broken, by coughs and sudden sneezes,\nBut still, a welcome respite, that momentarily appeases.\nMy bed, a sacred haven, where healing takes its hold,\nA refuge from the outside, a story to unfold\nOf quiet contemplation, and slow, deliberate rest,\nUntil my body strengthens, and passes every test."}, {"text": "Now when I have a cold, the world outside seems bright,\nA contrast to my dimness, my internal, hazy light.\nThe birds still sing their anthems, the sun still shines so bold,\nAnd life goes on unhindered, a story to be told\nOf vibrant, bustling energy, that passes by my door,\nWhile I remain a captive, wanting nothing more\nThan to rejoin the current, to feel the lively pull,\nBut for now, I am anchored, my senses feeling dull.\nIt's a strange separation, a window to a scene,\nWhere joy and movement flourish, while I remain serene\nIn my own quiet suffering, a temporary pause,\nUntil the body mends itself, defying nature's laws."}, {"text": "Now when I have a cold, I crave the simple things,\nThe warmth of steaming liquid, the comfort that it brings.\nA gentle hand upon my brow, a whispered, 'Are you well?'\nThe quiet hum of silence, breaking sickness's spell.\nNo grand pronouncements needed, no elaborate display,\nJust tiny acts of kindness, to brighten up my day.\nA soft and cozy sweater, a favorite, well-worn book,\nAnd knowing that someone cares, with every gentle look.\nThese small, unvarnished moments, possess a potent grace,\nReminding me of solace, in this vulnerable space.\nAnd in their quiet power, a healing starts to bloom,\nDispelling all the shadows, that gather in the room."}, {"text": "Now when I have a cold, my body feels so frail,\nA vessel temporarily broken, caught within a gale.\nEach movement is a challenge, each step a heavy chore,\nAnd simply standing upright, feels like a distant shore.\nMy muscles ache and throb, my joints feel stiff and slow,\nAs if a hundred tiny weights, are pulling me below.\nThe lightness has departed, replaced by leaden dread,\nAnd all I crave is stillness, nestled in my bed.\nIt's a profound reminder, of how much we rely,\nOn effortless mobility, beneath a boundless sky.\nAnd when the strength returns, a newfound grace I'll find,\nFor this temporary weakness, has left its mark on mind."}, {"text": "Now when I have a cold, my voice becomes a rasp,\nA croaking, unfamiliar sound, within my weary grasp.\nNo clear articulation, no ringing, vibrant tone,\nJust a gravelly murmur, that struggles to be known.\nEach word a small exertion, a burden to be met,\nAs if my vocal cords, are caught within a net.\nI speak in hushed intentions, in whispers soft and low,\nAfraid to strain the instrument, that struggles so to go.\nIt's a strange disembodiment, this loss of vocal power,\nReminding me of language, in this difficult hour.\nAnd when the clarity returns, a song I'll surely sing,\nFor the simple joy of speaking, the freedom it can bring."}, {"text": "Now when I have a cold, the world shrinks to my room,\nA cozy, self-made prison, dispelling outer gloom.\nThe curtains drawn against the sun, a soft and muted light,\nAnd every object familiar, a beacon in the night\nOf feverish confusion, and aching, weary dread,\nMy small domain a fortress, around my aching head.\nMy books, my scattered treasures, my mug of herbal tea,\nBecome my silent companions, comforting to me.\nNo distant lands to conquer, no journeys to embark,\nJust simple, close surroundings, leaving their gentle mark.\nAnd in this small enclosure, a quiet strength I find,\nTo weather through the sickness, and leave the world behind."}, {"text": "Now when I have a cold, my appetite takes flight,\nFood loses its allure, its flavor and its light.\nThe thought of solid morsels, feels heavy and too much,\nAnd even sweet temptations, escape my eager touch.\nBroth becomes my sustenance, a gentle, liquid grace,\nSustaining weary body, in this uncomfortable space.\nI sip and slowly swallow, a necessary chore,\nLonging for the day when hunger, returns once more.\nIt's a peculiar fasting, a forced and bitter plight,\nWhere nourishment is minimal, throughout the day and night.\nBut in this deprivation, a lesson I can glean,\nTo savor every mouthful, when health is once again keen."}, {"text": "Now when I have a cold, my dreams take on a hue\nOf strange and vivid imagery, both unsettling and new.\nThe fever paints landscapes, where logic takes a bend,\nAnd ordinary objects, to wild dimensions tend.\nI wake in hazy moments, unsure of what is real,\nAs nighttime phantoms linger, and strange emotions feel\nSo potent and compelling, a world within my head,\nWhere boundaries are blurred, and sanity is fled.\nIt's a temporary madness, a journey through the unknown,\nUntil the morning breaks, and reason is re-sown.\nAnd in these fleeting visions, a hidden truth I see,\nOf how the mind can wander, when the body isn't free."}, {"text": "Now when I have a cold, I see the world anew,\nThrough a prism of discomfort, a slightly altered view.\nThe simple act of breathing, a luxury it seems,\nAnd clear, unblocked sensations, become my fervent dreams.\nThe quiet hum of health, a blessing often missed,\nNow shines with newfound brilliance, by sickness gently kissed.\nEach sneeze, a small reminder, of vulnerability's call,\nAnd every sip of water, prevents a weary fall.\nIt's a forced perspective shift, a lesson hard-earned, deep,\nTo cherish every moment, while worries softly sleep.\nAnd when the cold has vanished, a gratitude I'll hold,\nFor the return of wellness, a story to be told."}, {"text": "Now when I have a cold, the outside world can wait,\nMy body's urgent signals, decide my present state.\nNo meetings or appointments, no errands to be run,\nJust self-care and quietness, until the course is done.\nThe phone remains unanswered, the emails go unread,\nMy only true priority, is resting in my bed.\nIt's a forced disengagement, from life's demanding pace,\nA temporary exile, in this secluded space.\nAnd though I feel the guilt, of duties left undone,\nMy body's wisdom whispers, until the battle's won,\nThat sometimes true production, and progress that's profound,\nComes from quiet stillness, on hallowed, healing ground."}]}

from a flower. / But in the distant shadows, a challenge I could see, / A test of my endurance, awaiting just for me. / It spoke of hidden pathways, of trials yet to come, / A journey of discovery, until my race was run. / And now, within your sunshine, my spirit starts to bloom, / The river's vibrant journey, dispelling every gloom.\", \"The river led me to you though the way was hard and long, / Through winding, narrow pathways, where silence felt so strong. / I felt the claustrophobia, the walls closing in near, / And battled inner demons, fueled by doubt and fear. / My breath was often

But in the rustling wheat, a whisper soft and low, / Spoke of a guiding presence, helping my spirit grow. / It spoke of patient tending, of seeds that would be sown, / A journey of fulfillment, where love would be known. / And now, within your richness, my spirit finds its ease, / The river's fruitful journey, has brought me perfect peace.\", \"The river led me to you though the way was hard and long, / Through misty, shrouded valleys, where ancient myths belong. / I felt the eerie stillness, the air both thick and cold, / And heard the whispered legends, stories ages old. / My mind was

hopeful, with every passing hour, / I gathered strength and courage, like blossoms from a flower. / But in the deeper shadows, a challenge I could see, / A test of my endurance, awaiting just for me.
