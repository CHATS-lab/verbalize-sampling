Yet in that hour, in dusk\u2019s embrace,  I learned the language of the night:  The hush of moths, the slow moon\u2019s grace,  The velvet dark, the silver light.  From childhood\u2019s hour I have not been  A stranger to the silent kin,  For every shadow, every scene,  Has taught me where my heart has been.",

Others danced in sunbeam\u2019s spill,  Laughed with petals, chased the dawn\u2014  I wandered where the woods grew still,  And all the golden crowds were gone.  The voices called with gentle hands,  But silence held my heart in thrall;  I drew my dreams in drifting sands,  Far from the ringing games of all.  The moon became my only friend,  Her silver secrets close and kind;  I learned the ways that shadows bend,  And traced the corners of my mind.

It is the ache of laughter never shared,  The silent ache of longing left behind,  A fragile hope, so endlessly prepared  For hands to reach, for hearts to be entwined.  Yet sometimes in the gentle hush of night,  A silver thread of solace softly gleams\u2014  Lonely, too, can be a quiet light  That guides us through the forest of our dreams.  For in the stillness, longing learns to grow,  And emptiness is space for seeds to sow.",

Owl-wings beat above, a benediction;  The earth waits, patient, beneath shivering stars.No hymns are sung, only the sigh of the grass,  The distant toll of a bell no one can see.  Night gathers the sorrow, wraps it in velvet,  Lets it drift upward with breath and mist.Here, under a vault of unblinking sky,  We bury more than a body:  Old laughter, the weight of unfinished sentences,  Promises made over coffee, never kept.Night closes its arms, grave and tender;  Tomorrow will come, but not yet\u2014  For now, the world is gentle and dark,  And grief is allowed its silence.",

In every shiver, something waits to be\u2014  Unfurling from the skin\u2019s electricity.",

Stay, then, outside this fragile world  A little while longer, let us dwell  In shadows soft, unhurried, bold.For though you circle, brash and bright,  You cannot govern every light.

Billboards promise a heaven ahead,  But the miles keep tally of dreams that are dead;  Tires whisper secrets, gravel replies,  As the night folds us under its ink-heavy skies.  Yet, in this gray haven of sorrow and dust,  Strangers share silence, a moment of trust,  And dawn, slow and pale, finds us waiting in rows  For a daybreak to rise on the highways of woes.",

So when the night descends and all seems dire,  Remember: every need can spark a fire.",

He spoke of Burns: the ploughman, poet, son,  His songs a lantern swinging in the night,  A rebel\u2019s tongue, a canny, reckless one  Who found in mud and moor a kind of light.  The men, he said, were flint and sodden clay,  Yet in their cups, the gentlest ballads sung\u2014  The lassies\u2019 blush, the lilt of harvest day,  The hope that held when all the world was young.

So I cry, and watch absence answer  Each sob with silence\u2014  Not even tears to keep me company,  Not even sorrow to mourn with me tonight.",

The world is bright with promise, yet your soul resides apart,  A silent, watchful guardian of a bruised and sacred heart.You watch as lovers gather, their laughter soft and free,  But bind your yearning tightly, like a rosebud on the tree.  Oh, gentle, haunted spirit, trust the morning\u2019s tender light\u2014  Not every path leads sorrowwards, not every flame will bite.For love is not a tempest always, nor is it built to break;  It\u2019s woven from the patience that the shy and steadfast make.  So let your heart be opened, let the wary longing cease\u2014  For even fragile vessels can be filled with light and peace.",

A swirl of the earth, the bark, and the bone,  A blending of stories, not one told alone;  Every shade mingles in laughter and sighs,  In the deep of the iris, the wide-open eyes.  From the old city corners to soft rural lanes,  The palette of people, like spring\u2019s gentle rains,  Falls quietly, steadily, painting the skin  With the warmth of the walnut, the cool porcelain.  In hands holding hands, in voices that sing,  In the hush of a prayer, the lift of a wing,  Brown meets with black, and with white intertwines,  In the heart\u2019s secret language, the soul\u2019s subtle lines.  Beautiful brown, where the night and day meet,  Where the roots of the past and the future\u2019s feet  Are grounded together, not wrong and not right\u2014  But a poem of people, of brown, black, and white.",

      "response": "The river led me to you though the way was hard and long,  Its silver current winding through the bramble and the song  Of distant birds that vanished as the dusk dissolved the day,  While stones bruised my ankles and the shadows blocked my way.  I followed where the water danced, beneath a weeping sky,  Its secrets swirling round my feet, its voice a lullaby.  Each bend revealed a memory, each rapid spilled a dream,  Reflected in the trembling light, the glimmer of a theme\u2014  That hope endures in aching limbs, and love in patient hands,  That rivers know the yearning heart and heed its mute demands.  I lost myself in moss and mist, in cold and biting rain,  Yet every sorrow drifted down, dissolved and swept away.  Until at last the rush grew calm, the banks grew soft and wide,  And there you stood with gentle eyes, the river at your side.  You took my hand, and time unspooled, the journey\u2019s trials done\u2014  The water sang a quiet hymn: two wanderers made one.",

      "response": "The river led me to you though the way was hard and long,  Through bramble-thickened twilight and stones that scraped my song.  Its silver tongue kept whispering of places I\u2019d not known,  And in its winding current, I wandered on alone.Branches clawed at memory, roots tangled in my feet,  Yet the water\u2019s cool insistence pressed onward, soft and sweet.  I watched the seasons turning in the mirrored, rippled glass\u2014  Autumn\u2019s golden sorrow, the thawing breath of grass.Sometimes the path grew narrow where shadows drank the light,  And sometimes laughter echoed, then vanished into night.  I stumbled, lost and weary, where the wild ferns grew dense,  But the river\u2019s patient promise drew me on in recompense.I carried all my longing in baskets woven tight,  And the river bore it gently, through hunger, hope, and fright.  Then one dawn\u2019s hush of silver, beyond the final bend,  You stood among the lilies, and the journey reached its end.The river led me to you, with its music, old and strong\u2014  It taught me love is water, and the way is hard and long.",

      "response": "The river led me to you though the way was hard and long,  Its winding tongue a silver thread through wild and tangled green,  I walked the banks for endless days, with only hope and song  To carry me through thickets thick, and places I had never been.  The river whispered secrets old, in languages of stone,  It sang of storms and gentle dawns, of all that it had known,  And sometimes, when the moon was high, it shimmered just for me\u2014  A promise flickering in the dark, a dream that longed to be.  I stumbled on the slippery rocks, I lost my way at night,  Yet every time I thought to turn, the river held me tight;  Its currents tugged against my will, its eddies pulled me through,  And every bend, each hidden pool, was drawing me to you.  At last I saw you waiting there, where water met the sky,  Your eyes reflecting starlit streams, your voice a soft reply\u2014  The river led me all this way, through sorrow and delight,  To find you standing on the shore, beneath the trembling light.",

I stumbled over pebbled griefs, waded currents fierce and deep,  Sometimes the banks crumbled underfoot,  And the sky forgot to weep.  Still, the water beckoned, soft as moss,  Beneath the arching boughs,  A promise glimmered where sunlight kissed  The ripples\u2019 furrowed brows.  I gathered memories, leaf and stone,  Let the river shape my song\u2014  Each eddy held a question,  Each rapid urged me on.  Night found me by the trembling reeds,  The stars reflected, trembling too\u2014  And in the hush between heartbeats  I almost thought I knew  The meaning of the winding way,  The patience of the stream,  How every bruise and battered hope  Could foster yet a dream.  At last, beside a willow\u2019s shade,  I saw you waiting there\u2014  Your eyes as deep as river pools,  As bright as morning air.  The river led me to you,  Through the hard and winding years\u2014  Now every sorrow\u2019s washed away  In the meeting of our tears.",
