before. \\n  The world, once grey, now burst in vibrant hue, \\n  Each leaf a gem, each drop of morning dew \\n  A sparkling promise, whispered on the breeze, \\n  Bringing a strange and unexpected ease. \\n  The burdens lifted, shadows fled away, \\n  Replaced by light, a brand new, hopeful day. \\n  No longer bound by fears I used to keep, \\n  I felt a joy both boundless and so deep. \\n  A silent song within my spirit stirred, \\n  A truth unspoken, finally heard. \\n  This fragile peace, a gift I hold so dear, \\n  Dispelling every doubt and every fear. \\n  For the first time, truly, I am here.\",\n  \"For the first time in my life, I saw \\n  The ocean's might, defying every law \\n  Of stillness known, a restless, roaring vast, \\n  A power that forever would outlast \\n  My fleeting days, my worries small and slight. \\n  The salty spray, a sudden, sharp delight, \\n  Awakened senses dulled by urban haze, \\n  And banished all my melancholy days. \\n  The endless horizon, a painter's dream, \\n  Reflected back a shimmering, silver gleam. \\n  Each crashing wave, a rhythm deep and low, \\n  Taught me a secret only oceans know: \\n  That change is constant, beauty always new, \\n  And in surrender, strength can carry through. \\n  For the first time, I felt truly free, \\n  Lost in the wild embrace of the sea.\",\n  \"For the first time in my life, I heard \\n  My own true voice, a long-forgotten word \\n  That echoed back from depths I'd kept concealed, \\n  A tender truth, at last to be revealed. \\n  No longer muffled by the world's loud noise, \\n  Nor shaped by others' expectations, choices, \\n  It rose unfettered, clear, and strong, and bright, \\n  A guiding star within the darkest night. \\n  The whispers faded, doubts began to cease, \\n  Replaced by calm, an unexpected peace. \\n  To speak my mind, to claim my rightful place, \\n  To show the world my unadorned face, \\n  Was liberation, potent and profound, \\n  A sacred space where only truth was found. \\n  For the first time, I truly understood \\n  The power held within my womanhood.\",\n  \"For the first time in my life, I felt \\n  A quiet calm, where anxious worries dwelt. \\n  The ceaseless hum of tasks and future dread \\n  Receded softly, from my weary head. \\n  A moment paused, beneath a sky so blue, \\n  Where nothing pressed, and nothing I must do. \\n  Just breath, and air, and sunlight on my skin, \\n  A gentle peace that settled deep within. \\n  The world outside could rush and roar and strive, \\n  But in this space, I felt truly alive. \\n  No past regrets, no future to define, \\n  Just simple being, exquisitely divine. \\n  A clarity descended, soft and deep, \\n  Awakening from a long, restless sleep. \\n  For the first time, I knew what it meant to be, \\n  Simply, utterly, and calmly, me.\",\n  \"For the first time in my life, I dared \\n  To step beyond the paths I'd always shared. \\n  The comfort zone, a cage I'd built so strong, \\n  No longer felt like where I could belong. \\n  With trembling hands, and heart a rapid beat, \\n  I faced the unknown, bitter and yet sweet. \\n  Each hesitant step, a victory won, \\n  Beneath the gaze of a forgiving sun. \\n  The fear, a whisper, tried to hold me back, \\n  But courage bloomed upon this untrod track. \\n  To stumble, fall, and rise again anew, \\n  To learn the strength that I always knew \\n  Lay dormant, waiting for its chance to bloom, \\n  Dispelling shadows, banishing all gloom. \\n  For the first time, I embraced the great unknown, \\n  And found a seed of greatness, deeply sown.\",\n  \"For the first time in my life, I knew \\n  The bitter taste of promises untrue. \\n  The fragile trust, so carefully instilled, \\n  By careless words, was utterly unfulfilled. \\n  A sharp awakening, a sudden sting, \\n  The disillusion that betrayal brings. \\n  The world, once painted in a hopeful light, \\n  Was plunged into a cold and starker night. \\n  No longer veiled by innocence's soft grace, \\n  I saw the cracks within a cherished face. \\n  The lesson learned, though painful and severe, \\n  Unveiled a truth that banished every fear \\n  Of seeing clearly, even if it pained, \\n  A wisdom hard-won, honestly attained. \\n  For the first time, I truly understood \\n  The darker side of human brotherhood.\",\n  \"For the first time in my life, I saw \\n  The silent beauty of a fallen leaf's flaw. \\n  Each tiny tear, each blemish, brown and slight, \\n  Reflected back a deeper, truer light. \\n  Perfection's mask, a burden I had worn, \\n  Was gently shed, no longer to be borne. \\n  The acceptance bloomed, a tender, soft embrace, \\n  For every line upon my weary face. \\n  The quiet wisdom in a weathered hand, \\n  A landscape etched, across a barren land. \\n  To find the grace in things imperfect, old, \\n  A story whispered, beautifully told. \\n  This gentle shift, a freedom from the strain, \\n  A quiet joy, washing away the pain. \\n  For the first time, I loved what I had found, \\n  In imperfections, sacred, holy ground.\",\n  \"For the first time in my life, I cried \\n  Not tears of sorrow, where my spirit died, \\n  But tears of pure, unburdened, sweet release, \\n  A sudden flood of unexpected peace. \\n  The dam had broken, built through years of strain, \\n  Holding back a deluge of old pain. \\n  Each drop that fell, a cleansing, healing balm, \\n  Restoring quiet to a lifelong storm. \\n  The tightened knot within my chest unbound, \\n  A silent comfort, finally found. \\n  No shame in weakness, no need to pretend, \\n  Just raw emotion, reaching to transcend. \\n  This gentle weeping, sacred and profound, \\n  On hallowed ground, where grace could now abound. \\n  For the first time, I let my spirit mend, \\n  And felt the healing journey truly end.\",\n  \"For the first time in my life, I felt \\n  A kinship deep, where loneliness had dwelt. \\n  A shared glance, a word that understood, \\n  A sense of belonging, truly good. \\n  The isolating walls began to fall, \\n  Responding to a silent, heartfelt call. \\n  No longer drifting, solitary, lost, \\n  But anchored now, no matter what the cost. \\n  A tapestry of souls, entwined and bright, \\n  Illuminating darkness with their light. \\n  To truly connect, beyond the superficial, \\n  A bond unbreakable, truly beneficial. \\n  This human touch, a warmth I hadn't known, \\n  A seed of unity, beautifully sown. \\n  For the first time, I was not alone, \\n  But part of something, deeply, richly grown.\",\n  \"For the first time in my life, I knew \\n  The quiet strength of seeing something through. \\n  Not just a task, completed and then done, \\n  But perseverance, till the victory's won. \\n  Through doubts and trials, setbacks and delay, \\n  I held my course, through every passing day. \\n  The inner critic, silenced by my will, \\n  As purpose drove me, upward, onward, still. \\n  Each small success, a fuel to light the fire, \\n  Fulfilling deeply, my heart's true desire. \\n  The satisfaction, earned with honest toil, \\n  A precious harvest from the fertile soil. \\n  This quiet power, rising from within, \\n  A journey finished, where it could begin. \\n  For the first time, I truly understood, \\n  The deep reward of doing what I should.\"\n]",

/ I could eclipse and cloud them with a wink, / But that I would not lose her sight so long. / If her eyes have not blinded thine, look, and tomorrow late, tell me, / Whether both th' Indias of spice and mine / Be where thou left'st them, or lie here with me. / Ask for those kings whom thou saw'st yesterday, / And thou shalt hear, 'All here in one bed lay.'\",\n  \"Busy old fool, unruly Sun, your golden glare, / Invades the sanctity of morning's air. / You rudely pierce the slumber, soft and deep, / Where weary souls in peaceful solace sleep. / What right have you to dictate dawn's decree, / To rouse the world with such fierce energy? / Go warm the fields, and ripen fruit on vine, / But leave my tranquil chamber, and my dream divine. / For in this haven, shadows gently play, / Untouched by the harsh judgments of your day. / Let clocks declare the hour, and birds their song, / But here, in quietude, I shall prolong / The sweet embrace of night, a cherished guest, / While your bright tyranny is put to test.\",\n  \"Busy old fool, unruly Sun, your fiery face, / Doth chase the lingering shadows from this place. / With brazen beams, you pry through every pane, / A tireless sentinel, again, again. / Must we obey your harsh and bright command, / And rise to toil across this waking land?
