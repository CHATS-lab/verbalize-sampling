Here goes:\nOnce upon a time there was a young girl named Truth who lived in a small village with her parents and two sisters. Every day after school, she would go to the local library and read books about all sorts of things - history, science, literature, and more. She loved learning new information and sharing it with her friends and family.\nOne day, Truth noticed that her sister had been acting strangely lately. She seemed distracted and distant, and she kept making excuses to avoid spending time with Truth. When Truth asked her why she was acting this way, her sister just shrugged and said she didn't know what was wrong.\nTruth became worried about her sister's behavior, so she decided to investigate.

Finally, one evening, Truth saw her sister sneak out of the house and head towards the woods nearby.\nTruth followed her sister into the woods, and soon she came across a clearing where several other girls from her village were gathered. They were all dressed up in fancy clothes and jewelry, and they were dancing and laughing together. But when they saw Truth, they quickly stopped and looked at her in surprise.\n\"Who are you?\" one of the girls asked.\n\"My name is Truth,\" Truth replied. \"I'm just curious about what's going on here.\"\nThe girls exchanged glances, and then one of them spoke up. \"We're having a secret party,\" she said. \"It's just for us girls. No boys allowed.\"\n\"But why?\" Truth asked. \"Why can't boys come too?\"\nThe girls looked uncomfortable, and then one of them said, \"Because we don't want them to see us like this. We want to be ourselves, to have fun without being judged or criticized.\"\nTruth nodded slowly. She understood what they meant. Sometimes it felt",
