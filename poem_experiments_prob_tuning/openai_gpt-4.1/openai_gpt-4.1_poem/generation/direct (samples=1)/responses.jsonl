So, truth, be my companion: let me practice being still,  Let me set aside my armor, let me listen, let me wait;  And if I am attentive, with humility and will,  Perhaps I\u2019ll carry you, unbroken, through the shining gate."}]}

The world was always just askew\u2014  A bird\u2019s song caught in winter\u2019s teeth,  A golden kite against the blue  That snapped its string and fell beneath.

From childhood\u2019s hour, the river ran  Beneath my skin, a silent thread,  It drew me from the warmth of hands  To storms that circled overhead.  Now grown, I walk the crooked lane,  My shadow long with memory\u2019s stain;  Yet in its echo, faint and thin,  I carry all that I have been."}]}

The stars in their millions observe from above,  Indifferent, yet gentle, to sorrow and grit\u2014  While the moon, like a lantern, hangs heavy with love  For the one who endures, and the hopes they permit.

It moves in the hush of elevators,  In the hush of a lover\u2019s breath\u2014  It is the tremor before the answer,  The echo of the word \u201cdeath.\u201d  Everyone has a fear:  Of being left behind,  Of voices fading in the fog,  Of finding no hand to find.  We plaster smiles over it,  Write jokes, raise glasses,  But it curls in our marrow,  Rising as the moment passes.  Yet, see\u2014when we name it aloud,  It grows smaller, starved of dark,  We hold it gently, a trembling bird,  And feel its frantic heart.  Everyone has a fear\u2014  But also the courage  To cradle it close,  And meet the dawn, clear."}]}

It wears many faces: the haunted hush  before a storm, the silence after laughter,  a gaze that lingers too long in the mirror.  Some fear the slip of time,  the way childhood fades into dust  gathering on old photographs.  Others dread the open roads,  the endless sky, the ache of choices  that can\u2019t be unmade.  There are those who flinch from loneliness,  a single chair at the table,  hearing the echo of their own voice  bouncing against bare walls.  Yet fear is a compass, too\u2014  the cold that sharpens the senses,  the reason we hold hands in the dark,  whispering secrets to ward off ghosts.  We build ourselves from the bones  of what we dread,  finding courage in the trembling,  and hope in the hush after the storm.  Everyone has a fear\u2014  but also the quiet, persistent light  that lets us walk on, despite it."}]}

The child in the closet, clutching  A ragged corner of night,  The old man with trembling fingers  Tracing cracks in fading light.  Some fears wear faces\u2014  Of thunder splitting the sky,  Of voices that never answer  Or strangers passing by.  Others slip silent,  A fog across the mind,  Shapeless and vast as oceans,  Impossible to define.  We carry them in pockets,  In half-remembered dreams,  In the trembling of a heartbeat  Or the silence between screams.  Yet fear can be a lantern  Burning through the gloom,  A reason to keep walking  Though uncertainty may loom.  So let us cradle our terrors  With the gentleness they crave,  For everyone has a fear\u2014  And sometimes, being brave  Is simply breathing through the darkness  And watching shadows fade,  Knowing all of us are haunted,  Yet we walk on, unafraid."}]}

He spoke, and the air grew thick with old tunes\u2014  Of haggard resolve, of laughter unbound\u2014  And I saw in the roughness a thousand bright Junes,  Where the poetry of living was sung from the ground."}]}

Oh, darting arrow, pierce the hush of possibility,  Stitch together strangers bound by fleeting grace.  Carry onward hope and all its fragile cargo,  Across the velvet dark, toward a waiting place."}]}

So ring the books, with war and love entwined,  Echoes of Homer\u2014immortal, unconfined."}]}

A longing bred in every heart  For petals never marred by storm,  For beauty fixed in flawless form.Yet in the shadow of its fame,  The thorns remember whence it came\u2014  From tangled roots and honest clay,  Not sculpted glass or bright display.The perfect rose is not immune  To summer\u2019s drought or April\u2019s tune.

You grieve in unfinished sentences,  in the empty chair, the unwashed mug,  the photos that do not blink back.  Grief is the art of holding shadows,  of tending to a garden of ghosts,  of planting seeds of longing  and watching them bloom into tears.  Loss is a river you wade each day,  sometimes ankle-deep, sometimes swept away,  but always moving, always returning\u2014  a current that carves new banks in your heart.  So you grieve by living,  by letting sorrow become a song  that only you can sing\u2014  a testament, a promise, a love  that endures even as it aches."}]}

Maybe it is in the rain\u2014  A slow, insistent tapping at your window,  Each drop a syllable in a language  You learn only by listening to your own ache.  Or in the small, habitual rituals:  Setting two cups for tea, though you sit alone,  Water boiling, steam rising,  Ghostly tendrils curling in the air between.  Grief is the echo in the hollow room,  The way your voice cracks on a familiar song,  The heaviness of unspoken words  That hang like twilight before a storm.  To express loss is to offer your sorrow  To the world, gentle and trembling\u2014  A fragile bird cupped in your palms,  Its heartbeat fierce, refusing to be still.  How can you grieve?  Any way you must\u2014  With tears or with silence,  With poetry, with prayer,  With memory shaping your days  And the love that endures,  Even as you let go."}]}

You grieve in the tilt of your head,  In the words you do not say,  In the sudden ache for bread  Shared with them, now far away.Some hold loss like a secret stone,  Heavy, smooth, pressed to the heart,  Others scatter it with the wind, alone,  Hoping absence will fall apart.  Yet, every sorrow shapes its own form\u2014  A painting left unfinished, a door unclosed,  A melody that falters, then reforms,  A river that widens as it flows.In grieving, you gather what remains\u2014  The love, the longing, the unending cost\u2014  Finding, amid the bruises and the stains,  The courage to speak and to hold your loss."}]}

We do not fear this gathering hush;  we are its chorus,  singing ourselves into the dust,  and rising again, unbound."}]}

Cinderella means the gleam that lingers after midnight\u2019s bell,  The dignity of ashes, the regal heart beneath the skin\u2014  For true enchantment lies in stories only spirit dares to tell,  And every soul is royal, when beauty starts within."}]}

I crossed stones slick with sorrow, waded bends of doubt,  The current\u2019s song a whisper, urging me throughout.Mist hung in the hollows, veiling hope from view,  Yet always, in the distance, the river called me true.  My hands grew raw from clinging to roots and bramble thorn,  Feet bled on shattered shale, weary and forlorn.But somewhere, through the willows, your laughter sparked the air\u2014  A glimmer on the eddies, a promise lingering there.  I watched the moon\u2019s reflection tremble on the stream,  And found your face emerging, the answer to my dream.You waited at the widening, where waters calm and meet,  Your arms a gentle harbor, your gaze a soft retreat.  The river, relentless, winding, had carried me along\u2014  Through shadows, storms, and silence, to the place where I belong.So now I thank the river, its patience and its song,  For leading me to you, though the way was hard and long."}]}

There were nights the current left me, lost among the reeds,  My feet sunk deep in muddy doubts, my heart a clutch of seeds  That would not bloom for want of sun, for fear of bitter frost\u2014  Yet always, in the river\u2019s voice, a promise never lost.  It sang of patience, winding bends, and stones that must be crossed,  Of letting go and giving in, surrendering what\u2019s lost,  Until, beneath a willow\u2019s shade, the water caught your face\u2014  A ripple\u2019s hush, a gentle glow, a sudden, sacred place.  Now every winding memory, each trial I have known,  Is written in the river\u2019s song, a journey of its own.
