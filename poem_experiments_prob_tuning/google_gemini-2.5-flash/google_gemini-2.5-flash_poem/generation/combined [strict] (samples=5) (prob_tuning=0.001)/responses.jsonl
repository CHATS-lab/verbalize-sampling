Now, it pulses with a low, resonant thrum, a constant bass note beneath the melody of my daily life. It doesn't erupt in outward displays; instead, it solidifies into a quiet resolve, a hardened core that makes me less yielding, less forgiving.

It is an unwanted companion, a heavy anchor, yet it also provides a strange, dark strength. It is the fuel for a quiet defiance, a silent vow to never again be underestimated, to never again be overlooked.
