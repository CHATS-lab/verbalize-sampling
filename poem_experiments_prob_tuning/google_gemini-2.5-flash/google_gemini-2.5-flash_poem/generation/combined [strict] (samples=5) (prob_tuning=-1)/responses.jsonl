The tears we shed are few,\nCompared to courage that forever shines in you.\nYour youthful vigor, spent on distant shore,\nHas bought us peace, and asked for nothing more.\nWe hear the echoes of your valiant cry,\nAs eagles circle in the endless sky.\nAnd though your voice may never speak again,\nYour spirit whispers through the wind and rain.\n\nADIEU, O soldier! A nation bows its head,\nRemembering the words your leaders said.\n'Go forth and conquer!' 'Fight with all your might!'\nAnd you obeyed, stepping into the night.\nNow peace descends, a blanket soft and deep,\nWhile grateful memories your legend keep.\nAnd from the dust, where heroes now reside,\nYour sacrifice, our freedom's endless tide.", "index": 2}, {"probability": 0.9, "text": "ADIEU, O soldier!

From duty's harsh command,\nYou found your peace in this forgotten land.\nNo more the fear that gnaws, the endless dread,\nJust quiet slumber for the brave who bled.\nYour comrades whisper tales of courage shown,\nOf sacrifices, silently unknown.\nAnd though the world moves on, in hurried pace,\nYour memory holds a consecrated place.\n\nADIEU, O soldier! The earth receives its own,\nUpon the seeds of freedom you have sown.\nFrom distant fields, where battles raged and burned,\nA timeless lesson, painfully we've learned.\nNow silence reigns, a profound, solemn hush,\nAs nature reclaims with a gentle rush.\nAnd in the stillness, where your spirit sleeps,\nA nation's gratitude forever keeps.", "index": 3}]}
