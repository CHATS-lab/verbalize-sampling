It suggests a person who readily absorbs external influences, lacking deep-seated convictions or a robust internal compass. This individual might be seen as a mirror reflecting the last person they spoke to, or the last idea they encountered, without critically processing or integrating it into a unique worldview. Their responses and behaviors could be predictable, almost mechanistic, as if following a pre-written script. \n\nThis could manifest in various ways: perhaps they adopt popular opinions without question, or their interests shift rapidly based on trends. Their conversations might lack genuine insight or personal reflection, relying instead on clich\u00e9s or borrowed sentiments. Emotionally, they might be perceived as lacking true depth, their reactions more learned responses than authentic feelings. The 'easily programmed' aspect implies a susceptibility to manipulation, a readiness to be shaped by others' agendas, whether benign or malicious. It's a characterization that evokes a certain fragility, a lack of self-definition that leaves them open to external imprints. In essence, it describes a person whose identity is less self-constructed and more externally assembled, a collection of borrowed parts rather than an organic whole.", "index": 4}]}
