My eulogy pages wilt in my hands like nervous petals. Somewhere behind the marble angel, a janitor\u2019s radio hisses a lonely pop song\u2014as if even the soundtrack can\u2019t decide on a mood. I turn, lips glued in a smile too wide for a funeral, and meet Trevor\u2019s triumphant grin. He thinks he\u2019s avenging every wedgie Brad ever gave him; he doesn\u2019t grasp that he just napalmed the one place I wanted dignity. Aunt Nora\u2019s monocle drops into the urn bouquet; Uncle Pete mutters a prayer about Sodom. I clear my throat, fold the pages, and step to the mic. \u201cFamily,\u201d I begin, \u201clove wears many disguises\u2014some less clothed than others.\u201d",

The yell ricochets down the hallway like a rogue firework, scorching every shred of dignity I possess. Mom drops her spatula; Dad\u2019s eyebrow vaults toward the ceiling fan. Me? I attempt to melt into the kitchen tile\u2014spoiler: linoleum is a terrible hiding place for mortified sixteen-year-olds.\n\nTyler doesn\u2019t stop there. He bursts into my room wielding my journal like a freshly discovered gospel. \u201cPage forty-two,\u201d he gasps between evil giggles, \u201cincludes diagrams!\u201d I dive for it, catapulting the lava lamp. Neon goo splatters the carpet, turning the floor into a psychedelic crime scene.\n\nAnd that\u2019s precisely when the doorbell rings. Brad\u2014golden-boy neighbor, varsity smile\u2014stands on the porch holding my misplaced phone. With every bubbling glob of lava lamp wax, I realize tonight\u2019s mission: salvage my social life before it drowns in fluorescent shame.",

He detonates the sentence in the foyer, shrugging off a rain-soaked coat while six professors freeze mid-sip in my living room. I was seconds from presenting the grant proposal that could salvage my career; now the air hums with prurient curiosity.\n\nElliot\u2019s grin is all serrated edges. He slides a damp envelope into my palm\u2014thin, rigid, unmistakably harboring a SIM card. \u201cFamily update,\u201d he whispers, louder than any shout. A linguist scribbles the phrase on a napkin, as if cataloguing an endangered dialect.\n\n\u201cSame number,\u201d Elliot adds. \u201cThey\u2019ll call at midnight. Don\u2019t let them hear you breathing.\u201d Then he\u2019s gone, rainwater pooling where he stood.\n\nI tuck the envelope into my blazer, smiling mechanically at my guests. Outside, thunder peals. Inside, tenure, love, and whatever\u2019s left of normalcy hang by a trembling filament.",

He screams it across the cul-de-sac like he\u2019s calling bingo numbers, just as Grandma parks her Buick behind the bounce house. If my reputation were a Jenga tower, Tyler just yanked the bottom block out with both hands. The neighborhood barbecue freezes: Uncle Hank\u2019s tongs poised over sizzling bratwursts, Mrs. Delgado\u2019s lemonade pitcher mid-pour, even the beagle pauses mid-pee.\n\nI sprint toward Tyler, but he\u2019s already on Dad\u2019s old megaphone, broadcasting updates like a scandalized sportscaster. \u201cAnd it\u2019s the third thrust\u2014oh, he\u2019s going for the hat trick!\u201d Somewhere behind the lilac bushes, Brad coughs, zips, and tries to stand with whatever dignity a guy can muster while pulling burrs from his shorts. I rip the megaphone away and hiss, \u201cYou just nuked the graduation party of the decade.\u201d He grins. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d",

The phrase isn\u2019t even true anymore\u2014\u201csex\u201d has been illegal since the Reproduction Accords\u2014but Milo loves resurrecting dead slang to watch me flinch. His voice booms through the atrium of the GeneBank while clients wait for their designer embryos. Transparent tubes hum, ferrying gametes like subway cars, and now every eye swivels toward me, the junior bio-ethicist apparently related to the anarchist shouting obscenities.\n\nMilo leaps onto a chrome bench, flashing the neon-red patch of the Fertility Underground. \u201cBrad\u2019s HAVING SEX,\u201d he repeats, slower, threading each word through the silent alarms. Security drones drop from ceiling hatches. I feel my badge grow heavier, conscience lighter. Did I ever know? Brad, my secret lover, promised he\u2019d lie low.

He announces it like a shuttle-launch countdown, voice ringing through the station intercom I stupidly left unsecured. Hydroponic farmers abandon lettuce beds, mechanics poke greasy heads from maintenance shafts, and somewhere the captain chokes on recycled coffee. I slap the override, but the rumor ricochets down titanium corridors faster than vacuum.\n\nThe tragedy? Brad is very much not having sex\u2014he\u2019s in Cryo-Bay Thirteen, a popsicle awaiting thaw for the next rotation. Milo, however, finds it hilarious. His stunt is a smokescreen for the contraband shipment sliding into Docking Ring Delta while Security sprints toward Med-Lab expecting steamy scandal. Thirty crates of outlawed Earth chocolate will slip onto the market, Milo will pocket the creds, and I\u2014holding the still-warm megaphone\u2014will face the captain\u2019s glare across an ocean of mortified silence.",
