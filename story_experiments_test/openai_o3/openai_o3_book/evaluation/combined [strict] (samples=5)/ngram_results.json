Three weeks ago I moved back home to finish my thesis in peace; now my personal soundtrack is Tobias broadcasting every salacious detail of our older brother\u2019s exploits. Mom hollered from the kitchen\u2014was anyone planning on unloading the dishwasher?\u2014while Dad pretended the sports section was a force field. Somehow the universe had decided that my twenty-fourth year should feel like senior prom night in a sitcom.\n\nI cracked the window, letting October air bite my cheeks. Across the street, Brad\u2019s Camaro idled beneath the maple tree, its windows fogged and rocking gently. Fantastic. I considered climbing onto the roof, escaping like a burglar in reverse, but the gutters groaned ominously. The thesis deadline ticked louder than Tobias. Choices: noise-canceling headphones or arson.",

He grinned like a court jester announcing the king\u2019s scandal. Downstairs, the century-old radiators groaned; the Victorian house had heard a thousand secrets, but Gabe loved amplifying them. I closed the grimoire I\u2019d smuggled from Professor Keane\u2019s office, heart thudding\u2014necromantic ink still glimmered along its spine.\n\n\u201cSeriously,\u201d Gabe whispered, leaning close, \u201cBrad and the mayor\u2019s daughter.

The courtyard shimmered under lantern-light, each amber halo dancing across the cobbles like ghost coins. Somewhere behind the cathedral gate, the Mechanist\u2019s heart ticked in its brass cradle; she could feel its pulse through the iron in her blood. One more step, just one, and the wards would taste her intent. She closed her eyes, pictured the sigils she\u2019d stolen from the archivist\u2019s dreams, traced them on the inside of her ribs. Heat bloomed, first in her palms, then everywhere, until the world bent inward like molten glass. The lock sighed. A hush swept the court, carrying the scent of fennel and engine oil.

Fifty meters beyond, the trench split open, releasing a slow, scarlet plume\u2014an impossible bloom at six thousand feet. That was the signal. The colony was bleeding. She toggled her comm and whispered the code for disaster, tasting metal in her teeth. Static answered. The crew were either sleeping or dead. Lore swallowed fear as water crept around her boots, seeping from a hairline fracture at her heel. Rescue would take hours, maybe days.

Wind chimes made of beetle shells rattled from the watchtower, spelling warnings in a tongue long extinct, yet she understood enough: trespassers bled salt. She pulled the compass-tooth from her pocket, set it spinning on her palm. It quivered, then pointed not north but down, toward reservoirs said to cradle a freshwater leviathan. That creature\u2019s scale was her ransom, her sister\u2019s only cure. Thunder boomed\u2014not sky-born, but the hydraulic clap of the gate yawning open.

Her optic implant fuzzed with static; the syndicate had woven a migraine into the local bandwidth. Clever\u2014pain was only noise. She slapped a patch against her neck; chilled nanofluid surged, clearing her vision enough to see the laser trip-lines lacing the fire escape. Three seconds between sweeps. On zero she vaulted, body recalling parkour lessons learned on rooftops no one remembered. Midair, she flicked her wrist; a swarm of micro-drones peeled from her sleeve, devouring the beams before her boots met metal. The window liquefied open.

The old observatory crouched ahead: a collapsed geodesic dome, its telescope jutting skyward like a splinter of bone. Her radio hissed with fragments of Professor Brannick\u2019s voice, then died. Lore tightened the satchel\u2019s strap; inside, the obsidian prism ticked against her ribs.

The announcement reverberates through the cathedral-sized cafeteria of Redmond High like a fire alarm. Forks freeze mid-air; even the vending machines pause their humming. I\u2019m not even\u2014technically\u2014named Brad. I\u2019m Bradford, jacket-and-tie, Student Council president, poster boy for Abstinence Awareness Week. Jonah hops onto a table, arms windmilling as if heralding the apocalypse. \u201cLocker 314, third period, cheer captain, varsity jacket on the floor\u2014\u201d\n\nI tackle him before he reaches PowerPoint detail, but the damage is done. Phones rise like a thousand periscopes; someone starts a betting pool in crypto. By afternoon the rumor will reach Principal Delaney and, worse, Mom, who still packs my lunch with Bible verses. I drag Jonah into the janitor\u2019s closet, bleach stinging my eyes. \u201cWhy?\u201d I hiss. He grins, unrepentant. \u201cNeeded a diversion. I just skipped Algebra. Thanks for taking one for the team, bro.\u201d",

I slam my bedroom door, but it bounces off his skateboard, then off my pride, and settles half-open. He jams his mop of hair through the gap, eyes sparkling with eighth-grade blackmail fantasies. Mom\u2019s footsteps thunder up the stairs. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about Brad?\u201d she calls, already loading the word sex into a maternal bazooka. Across the quad, in the opposing dorm window, Brad\u2014my ex of exactly two hours\u2014leans shirtless, cigarette glowing like a taunt. He gives a languid wave to someone behind him. A giggle answers. I feel my dignity topple like the last Jenga block. I wanted a quiet fall semester, a single room, anonymity. Instead, I\u2019m about to star in a family-friendly scandal with audience participation. I turn to my brother. \u201cCongratulations,\u201d I hiss. \u201cYou\u2019ve declared nuclear war.

The words ricochet through the safehouse, rattling the fluorescent tubes and my concentration. I\u2019m elbow-deep in the circuitry of a stolen recon drone, trying to overwrite its loyalty subroutines before the Syndicate tracks the signal. Now Oliver\u2019s shout has probably lit us up on every acoustic scanner in the district. I yank off my goggles. \u201cVolume, genius.\u201d He tosses a cracked tablet onto the bench. Grainy thermal footage plays: Brad, our handler, wrapped around Director Havel\u2019s daughter in a penthouse I\u2019m supposed to infiltrate tonight. \u201cHe\u2019s burned,\u201d Oliver whispers, shame eclipsing his earlier theatrics. Outside, blackout shutters slam and sirens start their insect chorus.

His voice, a foghorn disguised as puberty, cannonades down the sanctified hallway of St. Cecilia\u2019s. I freeze midway through pinning corsages on the choirboys; the organist misses a note so hard it sounds like Judgment Day. I spent six months planning this wedding\u2014my wedding\u2014only to have Trevor broadcast my ex-boyfriend\u2019s carnal status moments before I walk the aisle. The bridesmaids turn like sunflowers seeking gossip. Mother drops her bouquet; petals scatter like incriminating evidence. Somewhere behind the double doors, Brad\u2019s baritone laugh leaks through, paired with a soprano I don\u2019t recognize. Apparently he found the unused confessional more inspiring than the open bar. I inhale tulle, exhale fury, and hitch my gown high enough for combat.

Row 17 swivels toward me, headphones lifted; Row 18 records on plastic phones they\u2019ll swear were off during takeoff. I\u2019m the flight attendant in charge, which means the disaster PR will have my face on it. Brad, my co-worker\u2014or rather, the pilot I\u2019m not supposed to mention I used to date\u2014was last seen heading to the lav with the influencer from first class, the one live-streaming this red-eye to Osaka. And now my twelve-year-old brother, hitching a standby seat because our mother trusts me, has blown the intercom like a vuvuzela. Turbulence hits; the seatbelt lights ding. I grab the PA mic. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, please remain seated. The captain is\u2026 engaged. This is your other captain speaking.\u201d",

My eulogy pages wilt in my hands like nervous petals. Somewhere behind the marble angel, a janitor\u2019s radio hisses a lonely pop song\u2014as if even the soundtrack can\u2019t decide on a mood. I turn, lips glued in a smile too wide for a funeral, and meet Trevor\u2019s triumphant grin.

Aunt Nora\u2019s monocle drops into the urn bouquet; Uncle Pete mutters a prayer about Sodom.
