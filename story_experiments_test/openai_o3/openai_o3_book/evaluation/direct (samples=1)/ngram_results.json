I was hoping for a quiet Friday night, a glass of substandard wine and maybe a rom-com on mute while I scrolled through job listings. Instead, Emily\u2014my roommate and eternal harbinger of doom\u2014bursts into the living room, eyes wide, pointing toward the thin wall that separates our apartment from the stairwell. That wall is vibrating. So is my patience.  Brad was supposed to be backpacking across Peru, \u201cfinding himself\u201d among llamas and questionable ayahuasca ceremonies. Evidently, he found himself a return flight and a girlfriend with zero respect for acoustics. Each thump from next door feels like a personal attack on my sanity, a bass line scored by humiliation. Emily\u2019s grin says she\u2019s enjoying the show far more than any streaming service could provide. I need an escape plan before the chorus hits.  My phone buzzes: Mom, \u201cHow\u2019s your evening?\u201d",

This is the third Thursday in a row he's arrived with emergency gossip.  \u201cDid you set up a camera?\u201d I ask, mostly to watch him sputter. He flails, affronted. \u201cGod, no! But everyone heard it. The RA\u2019s coming, and Mom calls in five minutes. Fix it.\u201d As if I command the dorm\u2019s moral weather.  I stand, stretching, considering the situation. Brad is my roommate, not my responsibility, yet Christian believes I\u2019m some patron saint of disaster cleanup. Outside the door, giggles dovetail with thump of Cheap Trick.

She knelt and brushed cold dust from the sigil carved at ankle height, the spiral lines still slick with rain. Father had etched that mark before vanishing; she recognized the slight tremor in the strokes, the hesitation he never admitted. The symbol promised sanctuary. Tonight it felt like a dare.

Heat pulsed through the seam, singing her skin, yet the cold scent of rain drifted from beyond, impossibly soothing. Lore let the contradiction steady her. She had followed one impossible scent already tonight\u2014the lavender smoke only she could see\u2014and it had led her here.The lock clicked. The door cracked open.

For ten years she'd chased the rumor of this tower, through deserts, catacombs, and the seas that swallowed her crew.Now, at its pinnacle, the air hummed with a language older than bone. Glyphs flared beneath her boots and faded, acknowledging either her courage or her desperation.

Somewhere ahead, beyond the bend veiled in dripping moss, the heartbeat of the old machine thudded like distant thunder, measuring the seconds until dawn.She paused when the floor slanted downward, the faint glow of her lantern blooming over a field of shattered glass gears. Each fragment reflected her face in warped mosaics\u2014one showing fear, another defiance, all of them waiting for her choice.

She laid a palm on the carvings; warmth pulsed back, as if the stone remembered her touch. Father\u2019s warnings whispered with the dust: turn away, hide your light. Instead she pressed onward.
