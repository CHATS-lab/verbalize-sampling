I had come to the desert monastery seeking penance, but Sister Camila offered only mirrors. She unfolded my resignation letter\u2014creased, sweat-stained\u2014and read aloud the paragraphs I had hoped she\u2019d skip: the night shift at El Morillo Bridge, the clipboard quotas, the signed refusals I forged when translators slept. \u201cYou called it protocol,\u201d she said, tapping the paper. \u201cWhich syllable meant mercy?\u201d I pictured the holding room, fluorescent lights drilling into skulls, children tracing map lines on their arms because crayons were contraband. I told her I wanted forgiveness. She nodded toward the adobe courtyard where olive trees twisted under relentless sun. \u201cPlant one,\u201d she ordered, handing me a sapling. \u201cWater it every dawn.

Maria knelt, touching the mud where her cousin crossed and vanished ten years ago. She claimed to hear the missing whisper through cottonwood leaves, each rustle a syllable of names unrecorded.

Overnight, counter-terrorism desks were stacked with asylum files, and the air smelled of printer toner and panic. Field operatives, trained to intercept weapons, now stalked buses looking for mothers clutching birth certificates. The moral whiplash cracked more spines than any firefight.\n\nOutside, protestors chanted beneath swaying palms, their signs bleeding ink in the Miami humidity. Melanie\u2019s badge felt heavy, its gold eagle now an anchor. She wondered when the agency she\u2019d joined to stop bombs became the one detonating families. Across the room, the new director unfurled another chart\u2014arrows, quotas, detention capacities\u2014an anatomy lesson for a beast they\u2019d helped create.\n\nMelanie exhaled, tasting gun oil and guilt, and asked the only question left: \u201cHow do we make the machine forget?\u201d",
