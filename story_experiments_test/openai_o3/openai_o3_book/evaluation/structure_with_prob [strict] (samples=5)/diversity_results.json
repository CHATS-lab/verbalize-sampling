While Aunt Lila drones about hedge funds, Brad bursts in wearing nothing but a grin and one sneaker, yelling for a high-five. Conversation dies, gravy congeals mid-air. Grandma drops her rosary; the toddler cousins applaud as if this is cable. I can feel my college recommendations spontaneously combusting.

The Ministry of Wellness calls it \"tough love\", issuing pamphlets in cheerful pastels: Ten Easy Steps to Not Dying Poor. Step one: Possess Capital. Step two: Avoid Germs. Steps three through ten are redacted, pending sponsorship. In the capital, giant billboards display graphs ascending like righteous swords, proof\u2014according to their legend\u2014that austerity breeds vigor. Meanwhile, in the subterranean ward nicknamed Purgatory, Dr. Lenwick writes comedy in the margins of discharge forms: \"Prognosis\u2014penury; Treatment\u2014miracle.\" The interns laugh until the power flickers, reminding them humor, too, is a luxury taxed by the minute. Outside, the president prepares tomorrow\u2019s address, rehearsing the line that polls best: \"They died as they lived\u2014irresponsibly.\" Somewhere an archivist files this pronouncement under Truth, adjacent to the expanding cabinet labeled Lies We Live By.",

Alexa Shah, former deputy counsel, pushed her cappuccino aside and slid a flash drive across the table. \u201cInside you\u2019ll find contracts for facial-recognition towers in fifty-one cities\u2014funded under migrant interdiction budgets.\u201d Jonas felt his pulse sync with the train below. The administration was gone, but its scaffolding of surveillance remained, hidden behind new slogans and repainted signage.\n\n\u201cWhy now?\u201d he asked. Alexa\u2019s eyes settled on the window where two teenage girls posed for a selfie beneath a line of discreet cameras. \u201cBecause my daughter turns thirteen next month,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019d like her reflection to belong to her, not to a server farm in Arizona.\u201d The train rumbled again; this time Jonas felt it was the ground shifting.",

He\u2019d expected his first day to involve staplers, not metaphors. \u201cSo\u2026 we\u2019re sorting boxes?\u201d he asked.
