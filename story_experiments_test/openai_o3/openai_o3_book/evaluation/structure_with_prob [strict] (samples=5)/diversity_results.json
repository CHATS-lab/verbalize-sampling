The lecture hall fell silent, save for the hum of holographic projectors. Professor Amina Zhu waved her hand and the image of a towering biometric wall shimmered behind her. \u201cWe inherited a fortress mentality,\u201d she said, \u201cand turned it into architecture.\u201d The graduate students studied the digital map where drones patrolled invisible corridors of jurisdiction stretching far beyond the physical border. One student leaned forward. \u201cBut isn\u2019t the wall obsolete now that climate caravans cross the Arctic?\u201d Amina smiled sadly. \u201cObsolete? Perhaps. Yet its algorithmic descendants screen every breath you take.\u201d She dimmed the display, revealing archival footage: toddlers in silver blankets, agents in riot gear, senators in applause. \u201cPolicy is memory manifested,\u201d she continued. \u201cIf we fail to remember, we replicate.\u201d Outside the window, the first flakes of June snow drifted over a flooded Manhattan.",

My mother used the English she\u2019d polished scrubbing office toilets, forming each consonant like a fragile ornament. She wasn\u2019t talking about policy memos or budget lines; she meant the way men in green uniforms marched into our apartment the night after Thanksgiving and rearranged the geography of our lives. DHS, those three letters, became an eclipse over every sunrise. At church, parishioners prayed in whispers, afraid the walls might testify. At school, I learned to differentiate boredom from terror by how hard my classmates breathed when the door creaked. Months later, Mama and I waited inside a glacial courtroom painted the color of cold milk. She squeezed my hand and repeated the sentence, softer this time, as if it were an incantation to summon courage. I realized then she was teaching me the power of naming a wound.",

We were at the Annual Bureaucratic Survivors Meet-and-Greet, where former officials compared PTSD and pension plans over watered-down mojitos. Across the bar, a gaggle of ex-ICE lawyers played Jenga with redacted documents. \u201cYou see,\u201d she continued, \u201cwe used to chase terrorists. Then someone decided toddlers with Paw Patrol backpacks were the real threat.\u201d She took a dramatic sip. \u201cSo we rebranded\u2014Operation Sippy Cup.\u201d I nearly snorted gin through my nose. \u201cLet me guess, mission statement: securing the homeland from teething rings?\u201d \u201cClose,\u201d she winked, \u201cbut with more PowerPoints.\u201d The band struck up a mariachi rendition of \u201cBorn in the U.S.A.\u201d I watched her toss her badge into the tip jar. \u201cFreedom,\u201d she declared, \u201cis knowing you\u2019ll never have to write another memo titled \u2018Provisional Pacifier Disposal Protocol.\u2019\u201d",

Her voice rustled like pages in a forbidden archive as we stood before the border wall, which had begun sprouting jacaranda blossoms at dawn. No one knew why steel suddenly remembered how to bloom, but rumors said it absorbed the dreams of children held in its shadow. Each violet petal glowed with an echo: lullabies in Mixtec, prayers in Arabic, bedtime stories left unfinished. The agents posted along the ridge kept their rifles lowered, unsure whether flora fell under their jurisdiction. She traced a weld seam, and a cluster of flowers opened, releasing paper butterflies bearing case numbers in bureaucratic ink. \u201cPolicies are spells,\u201d she whispered. \u201cCast them in fear and the land will answer in sorrow\u2014or resistance.\u201d A gust lifted the butterflies skyward, carrying their silent docket toward an uncharted horizon.",
