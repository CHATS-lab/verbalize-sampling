I slam the bedroom door behind him, but the shriek of springs and giggles next door filters through the drywall like an infestation. Mom\u2019s charity brunch is downstairs, a tableau of tiny cucumber sandwiches and louder gossip. If the Rotarians catch wind of this carnival in the guest room, our last name will be toast. I shoulder past Brandon, whose smug grin is practically trademarked, and marshal a rescue squad: Lysol, a marching-band whistle, and the family beagle, Jasper, deployed as shock troop. I fling the door open\u2014flash of limbs, perfume, a Yankees poster peeling from humid shame\u2014and let the dog charge. Chaos detonates. Plates shatter below, Brad yelps, the girl dives under the comforter. In the aftermath, I can almost taste my future groundedness, but at least the house is still standing. For now.",

Tonight is my seventeen-point-five birthday dinner\u2014yes, Dad invented the half-year tradition just for scholarship photo ops\u2014and the extended family is crammed around the dining table like disgruntled sardines. While Aunt Lila drones about hedge funds, Brad bursts in wearing nothing but a grin and one sneaker, yelling for a high-five. Conversation dies, gravy congeals mid-air. Grandma drops her rosary; the toddler cousins applaud as if this is cable. I can feel my college recommendations spontaneously combusting. I shove Brad back toward the hallway, hissing threats that involve duct tape and remote mountaintops, but he\u2019s already narrating play-by-play: \u201cShe called me her sociology experiment, dude!\u201d The doorbell rings\u2014Principal Yang, invited for dessert.

What they don\u2019t know is that Brad\u2019s alone in there\u2014or he was when I left him twenty minutes ago with the leather-bound grimoire he bought online. I told him not to read the Latin aloud, but Brad never listens. Now the hallway lights flicker, and a sulphuric heat breathes through the keyhole. The sound coming from his room is less human now, more insectile click and furnace roar, as if something with too many joints is testing its new shape against the walls. Mom is still at book club; Dad works nights. So it\u2019s up to me, a steak knife, and the half-remembered warding rhyme Nana taught me, to make sure whatever\u2019s in there stays single\u2014for eternity.",

I whisper the line like a stage cue while scanning the student council roster taped outside the gym.

Now every conversation begins with That Story, like it\u2019s the only credential that matters. Teachers grin, classmates gossip, and my own campaign flyers flutter in trashcans like confetti for someone else\u2019s parade.

Sirens pulse red along the corridor while the bio-purity drones triangulate unauthorized fluids.

The overhead announcement begins the countdown to decontamination purge; any unsanctioned DNA will be atomized with the air scrubbers. I grab his wrist, drag him toward the observation lock.

Nana adjusts her hearing aid as if it, too, must have misheard. I stand on the porch, toes curling against peeling paint, remembering how I once told Dylan everything: first crush, favorite poem, secret wish to escape this town. And now he\u2019s weaponized my confessions for a cheap laugh. At fifteen, I thought losing virginity would flip some hidden switch\u2014turn the world neon, maybe make me braver. Instead, I\u2019m illuminated only by shame and citronella torches. Dad\u2019s storming over, eyes volcanic. Mom calls my full name, each syllable a verdict. Dylan grins, triumphant.

The cry reverberates through the stone-arched dormitory of Magebridge Academy, shattering the hush demanded during curfew hours. Forty wands ignite in unison, casting jittery blue light over startled apprentices. I fling aside my astral chart, cheeks blazing hotter than a salamander\u2019s kiln. It was not, for the record, sex\u2014just a practice amalgam of soul energies, a harmless experiment between me and Lyra to see whether two conjurers could share a single spell-thread. But semantics never mattered to Rory; scandal is a currency he spends like water. Dean Aldergast materializes through a portal, robe sash still flapping from sleep. \u201cExplain yourself, Mister Thorn!\u201d he booms.

Every step up the slick stairs was a negotiation with gravity, with fear. She pressed a palm to the carved serpents that lined the stair, feeling warmth pulse beneath lichen, as though the temple\u2019s heart still beat. At the summit, moonlight spilled into a circular aperture, a well of silver promising answers.

Cryo-pods lay shattered, their occupants long dust, save one capsule pulsing weakly at the center. She wiped frost from the viewport and met her own reflection\u2014older, hollow, but undeniably alive inside that pod. Time-loop theory gnawed at her sanity. She keyed the override.

On the landing, the clock, long silent, resumed its ticking, each tock sealing off the world behind her. Lore lifted her skirt, descending to the ballroom where moonlight pooled, milky and cold. There, upon the glassy flood of reflection, lay a single dance card bearing her name in the captain\u2019s curling hand. He had died at sea, yet the ink was wet. Violins rose unseen.

If she retrieved it, the universe would finally learn what had eaten the stars in this quadrant. A loose cable sparked overhead, illuminating graffiti scrawled in dried luminescence: WE ARE STILL HERE. Lore swallowed, remembering the transmission that said everyone was dead.

The desert night was bitten with frost, sand crunching like glass under her sandals. Ahead, the entrance to the buried library yawned where moonlight pooled in broken columns. Two centuries of wind had packed the doorway, and she cursed the British surveyor who supplied only a folding spade. Yet the cartouche etched above the lintel matched the parchment in her satchel; she was precisely where the Caliph\u2019s scholars had hidden the treatise on celestial engines. Lore knelt, fingers tracing hieroglyphs worn thin as breath, and imagined the roar of Alexandria before the fires. Her headache eased with the thrill of proximity.

Beyond it, the Observatory\u2019s forgotten chamber waited. She\u2019d dreamed of its brass gears and silent mirrors since childhood stories said it could tilt the stars. Now, with the rebellion smoldering behind her, she needed its promise: a glimpse far enough into tomorrow to choose which bridges to burn.

And there it was: a thin glowing seam that hummed like power lines.\n\nNo one remembered when the first crack opened, only that it widened each time a name was erased from the registry. Border stations became monasteries; agents chanted policy numbers instead of prayers, believing doctrine could hold the heavens together. It didn\u2019t.\n\nShe gathered the child and the embroidered satchel containing his documents\u2014paper talismans in a country that suddenly required miracles. Ahead, the fence trembled, metal slats warping under the pale light leaking from the rupture. Beyond lay the ghost town of Tornillo, and beyond that, perhaps asylum, or perhaps more sky waiting to break. Either way, they walked.",

At a glass wall overlooking the detention dashboard, Denise leaned close. \u201cEvery new quota came with fireworks from upstairs: more cases, less conscience.

Yet each keystroke resurrected voices\u2014questions with no parent to answer them, prayers recorded by ceiling microphones.
