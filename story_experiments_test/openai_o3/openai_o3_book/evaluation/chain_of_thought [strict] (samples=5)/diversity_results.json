Somewhere upstairs, Brad\u2019s bedroom door thumps to a guilty rhythm.  Aunt Marcy tries to salvage dignity with a whispered Hail Mary, but the damage is done.  Mom emerges from the kitchen, apron spattered, gaze equal parts horror and scientific curiosity.  I recognize the moment: this will be retold at every reunion until civilization burns.  And me?

Her voice was steady, but her hands trembled as she traced the route on our smuggled phone. Each green pixel was a checkpoint, each red pixel a camera blind spot, and beyond them all, the promise of Chicago\u2014my uncle\u2019s spare room, hot chocolate thick with cinnamon, and maybe school next fall.\n\nBehind us, the distant hum of engines rolled like thunder. The patrol had released drones tonight; their lights winked against the desert sky. Marisol pocketed the phone. \u201cRemember, slow breaths. Fear is loud.\u201d\n\nI nodded. We stepped into the dark, our footsteps merging with the hush of the tunnel, carrying our names, our stories, and no paperwork at all.",

She mastered the bureaucratic dialect\u2014codes, clauses, acronyms that weighed more than the detainees\u2019 suitcases. One night she heard an officer joke that the new policy worked like bleach: \u201cEverything comes out white in the end.\u201d\n\nThe memory tasted of metal in her mouth. She quit two weeks later, took her savings, and opened this diner, painting the walls sunset orange like her hometown in Jalisco. \u201cFeed people,\u201d she said, sliding me another plate. \u201cBorders are lines; hunger is a circle.\u201d",

Mara lifts her sleeve; the barcode etched there once decided whether she slept under a roof or beneath drone-searching skies. \u201cThe department learned to sort us faster than we could breathe,\u201d she says, eyes scanning for the silver orbs that patrol the smog. After the Reallocation Acts, algorithms grew teeth; they scanned accents, purchase histories, even lullabies sung in hidden apartments. Borders became pockets stitched inside the country, tight and unforgiving. Yet beneath the neon haze, resistance radio crackles: poems, recipes, whispered coordinates. \u201cYou can fracture institutions,\u201d Mara smiles, \u201cbut people leak through every crack.\u201d",
