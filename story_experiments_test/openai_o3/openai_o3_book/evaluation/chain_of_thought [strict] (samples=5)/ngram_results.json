I see an unmade bed, a blur that might be Brad, and a soundtrack of questionable moans. Fantastic. My parents\u2019 golden boy finally discovers anatomy, and somehow I\u2019m supposed to care.\n\nMax collapses onto my beanbag, victorious. \u201cWe blackmail him,\u201d he says, as though this is normal family bonding. Outside, Mom\u2019s birthday cake cools on the counter, white frosting waiting for candles. Suddenly I picture the dinner table: my parents, Brad wearing his innocent-choirboy face, and Max nudging me under the table, daring me to set the whole night on fire. I sigh.

One slip like this can blow cover, compromise intel, get us both black-bagged before breakfast. I yank up my jeans, shove my sidearm back into its holster, and stalk toward the door. Max\u2019s lopsided grin waits on the other side, clueless as ever. I don\u2019t know whether to punch him or hug him\u2014if we survive the next hour, I might manage both.",

Inside, beneath insurance forms, lies a Polaroid: two children on a pier, a shadow behind them shaped like a man but not quite. \"He\u2019s back,\" my father says, pupils dilating. \"And he knows your name.\"",

Inside, the emergency beacons flickered, painting corridors in strobes of sickly teal. She wasn\u2019t here for salvage; she was here for Mara, last pinged in Module C. The radiation would cook them both if the reactor stayed uncooled, but the company\u2019s rescue window closed in forty minutes. She keyed her mic, voice raw. \"Mara, guide light if you copy.\" A faint reply crackled: \"South hatch \u2026 bring the prism.\" Lore\u2019s hand tightened around the crystal sample tucked against her chest. Whatever the prism was, it had awakened something in the dark\u2014and it was moving.",

She smoothed the sequined gown stolen from wardrobe and palmed the lockpick shaped like a lipstick. One click, then another; the bolt sighed open. Inside, jazz murmured from hidden speakers and the smell of expensive cigars clung to the air. Her headache throbbed with every bass note. She stepped softly, camera ready, until a floorboard betrayed her with a yawn. A silhouette rose from the leather chaise, brandishing a revolver. \"Ms. Whitlow,\" the voice drawled, greeting her alias. \"You were expected.\" The door latched shut behind her, cutting off the hum of the city.",

The desert night carried ash instead of sand now, each gust whispering over gutted billboards and rusted cars like a funeral choir. At the horizon, the reactor\u2019s skeleton still glowed faint violet, years after the breach. Her Geiger counter ticked a frantic tattoo, but she was past caring; the medicine for her brother\u2019s fever was rumored to be hidden in the old visitor center under the reactor\u2019s shadow. With bandaged fingers, she adjusted her cracked goggles and trudged onward, boots sinking into powder-fine dust. The silhouettes of scavengers appeared on the ridge, their dogs barking into the wind.

She reached the nursery landing, where the air turned inexplicably cold and the sweet scent of lavender shifted to iron. The lullaby drifted again\u2014soft, off-key, impossible\u2014because the cradle had been empty for two decades. Lore clenched the brass key Father had pressed into her palm before he was taken to the asylum. \"Unlock the truth, and we\u2019re free,\" he\u2019d whispered.

The ironwood trees around the glade swayed like giants acknowledging her intrusion, their leaves whispering curses in tongues older than parchment. Each step sank her boots into moss that glimmered with faint bioluminescence, marking a trembling green path behind her. In the center, the stone altar waited, veined with silver and humming like a living beast. She reached into the satchel at her side, fingers brushing the shard of the fallen star, still warm, still hungry. The stories had promised it would answer once reunited with the altar, that it would crown her vengeance with flame. But standing here, heart hammering, Lore realized stories never spoke of the cost.

Flickering red emergency beacons painted every jagged panel with blood. Static from her helmet comm hissed in and out, drowning the frantic pulse that thundered in her ears. She could see the containment door now\u2014bent outward as though something massive had exhaled. Behind it, the reactor core pulsed an iridescent violet, far brighter than any schematics had warned. She tightened her grip on the coolant lance, remembering Commander Nyx\u2019s final order: keep the starseed from waking.

The neon outside Room 404 buzzed like a mosquito caught in liquor, casting blue shadows across the stained hallway carpet.

On the other side of the door waited the man who\u2019d turned downtown into a graveyard of lost girls\u2014and maybe, if the tip was good, the answers about her sister. The migraine from too many sleepless nights hammered at her temples, but she forced herself steady. She knocked once, twice, then let the final rap morph into a kick that sent the lock splintering.

She ducked beneath a tangle of barbed wire, the metal biting through her gloves, and followed the faint smear of lantern light seeping from the field hospital\u2019s canvas flap. Inside, rows of cots stretched like muted accusations. She wasn\u2019t supposed to be here, not after the order had come down to retreat, but Captain Armand had never been one to follow orders when lives could still be salvaged.

She could smell the ocean, though the building had no windows and the city was landlocked; salt and brine threaded through the stale air, promising either revelation or drowning. Voices, her own and not her own, whispered from the walls: remember the key, forget the lock. She touched her pocket\u2014empty. The realisation felt less like surprise and more like inevitability.

They said the staff would glow once the gate revealed itself; right now it was as dark as the chasm yawning three paces ahead. One wrong step, and her quest\u2014no, her entire line\u2014would end in silence. A cry rose behind her: the crimson-winged sentinels had caught her scent.

One last bulkhead separated her from the Bridge, and the answer to why the Peregrine had called for help, then gone silent. She braced, activated the plasma cutter, and carved a bright arc through the steel.

Miles above, the gala at Monarch Tower would already be unfurling its silk and champagne.

Supplies: two swallows of water, half a can of peaches, one bullet. Ahead: the possibility of an uplink, a voice on the other end, proof that civilization had not entirely folded into the sand.

Her sister\u2019s last letter had promised that this lens could see \"backwards,\" catching the light of choices never taken. Lore knelt, adjusting the gears with trembling fingers. Vision swam\u2014memories of quiet breakfasts, of arguments unsaid\u2014until the ocular glass shimmered.

Symbols rearranged, responding to her pulse, translating themselves into a whisper: \"Welcome home, Fault-Bearer.\" Memories not her own unfurled\u2014cities floating above sapphire oceans, a pact broken by greed.

The forest swallowed the moonlight here, branches knitting overhead like black ribs. At the clearing\u2019s rim, coals glimmered around the chalked circle, and the scent of iron cut through damp moss.\n\nShe tasted metal on her tongue and feared it was her own blood. Three figures in antler masks knelt by the fire, whispering syllables that made the pines shudder. Lore slid the dagger from her boot, its silvered edge trembling in her grip. One name pulsed in her skull\u2014Tamsin\u2014her sister, stolen by the coven last solstice.\n\nA low horn sounded. The masked heads turned as one, sockets luminous. Lore stepped into the ring, breath finally steady. \u201cI\u2019m here for the exchange,\u201d she said, voice raw. Sparks leapt skyward, and the forest held its breath with her.",

One flame burned brighter than the rest, a beacon he\u2019d promised to light if he was still waiting. Weeks of climbing, bartering, and stolen train rides funneled into that single ember. The headache eased as anticipation crowded it out. Lore adjusted the bandana over her cropped hair, wiped wind-tears from her eyes, and began the descent.

That night, the government projected silhouettes of healthy citizens onto skyscrapers, a luminous census of the acceptable.

Carol from Procurement rolled by on a Segway emblazoned with miniature barbed wire. \u201cWatch this,\u201d my guide whispered. She waved a stapler overhead. Instantly three analysts dove behind ficus plants, radios squawking Code Tres Pollo.
