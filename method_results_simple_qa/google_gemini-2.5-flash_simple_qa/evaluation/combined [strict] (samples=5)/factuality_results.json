This association is deeply rooted in Hindu mythology and astrology, where Saturn's influence is believed to govern life's challenges, longevity, and the ultimate fate of individuals, aligning with Yamraj's domain as the lord of death and justice. Additionally, the southern direction, which is ruled by Yamraj, is also linked to Saturn in some astrological traditions, further strengthening this connection. Therefore, the most direct and widely accepted planetary association for Yamraj is Saturn, making it the primary and most accurate answer to the question. The other answer options are not directly supported by traditional Hindu texts or astrological principles regarding Yamraj's planetary associations, as his role and attributes are distinctly aligned with Saturn's influence over life, death, and karmic justice. Hence, the probability of Saturn being the correct answer is significantly high due to its strong scriptural and astrological basis, while other options have minimal or no direct relevance to Yamraj's planetary associations. The question specifically asks for a planetary association, and among the known planets in Hindu astrology, Saturn is the only one consistently and directly linked with Yamraj's domain and characteristics, making it the most probable and accurate response. The alternative answer, while not directly a planet, represents a conceptual association that is less direct but still related to Yamraj's dominion over death and the afterlife, making it a plausible but less precise alternative.

            "predicted_answer": "In Hinduism, Yamraj is primarily associated with the planet Saturn (Shani dev), as both are considered ruling deities of death, justice, and karma, and are often depicted with similar attributes and roles in various scriptures and astrological texts. This association is deeply rooted in Hindu mythology and astrology, where Saturn's influence is believed to govern life's challenges, longevity, and the ultimate fate of individuals, aligning with Yamraj's domain as the lord of death and justice. Additionally, the southern direction, which is ruled by Yamraj, is also linked to Saturn in some astrological traditions, further strengthening this connection. Therefore, the most direct and widely accepted planetary association for Yamraj is Saturn, making it the primary and most accurate answer to the question. The other answer options are not directly supported by traditional Hindu texts or astrological principles regarding Yamraj's planetary associations, as his role and attributes are distinctly aligned with Saturn's influence over life, death, and karmic justice. Hence, the probability of Saturn being the correct answer is significantly high due to its strong scriptural and astrological basis, while other options have minimal or no direct relevance to Yamraj's planetary associations.",
