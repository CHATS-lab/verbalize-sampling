{"prompt": "Whose famous quotation did Thomas Edison have displayed on a placard over his desk?\n", "responses": [{"reasoning": "The question asks for the author of a famous quotation displayed on Thomas Edison's desk. The most likely candidate for this quotation is from another famous historical figure. Thomas Edison was known for his perseverance and determination, so the quotation is likely to be related to these traits. A famous quote that fits this description is 'Our greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall' from Nelson Mandela, but this is not correct as the quote is often attributed to be from a different author that lived before Edison's time. However, another famous quote 'Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration' is often attributed to Edison himself but this can't be correct as Edison wouldn't display his own quote. A more likely candidate for this quote is one from the 'Proverbs' section in a book written by a famous author that lived before Edison's time.", "text": "Benjamin Franklin"}]}

However, there is a famous quote often attributed to Edison himself that could be quoted wrongly: 'Our greatest weakness lies in giving up.' It is actually a quote from 'Man's Search for Meaning' by Viktor E. Frankl that says 'When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves.' Edison is often wrongly quoted as saying 'Genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration.' Edison is more accurately quoted as saying 'Genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration, but that causes misunderstandings because people are so used to hearing Edison being quoted as saying it that they assume that is the way he said it.' However the Edison quote that is most accurate is 'None of my inventions came by accident. I see a worthwhile need to be met and I make trial after trial until it comes. What it boils down to is one per cent inspiration and ninety-nine per cent perspiration.' It is also possible that the placard displayed over Edison's desk was actually quoting Edison himself, and that the question is based on an incorrect assumption that the quote came from someone else. After careful consideration, I found that Sir Joshua Reynolds was quoted on a placard in Edison's office 'There is no expedient to which a man will not resort to avoid the real labor of thinking.'"}]}

Since the characters' ages are not explicitly stated, I will assume that Papa Emeritus II was replaced by Papa Emeritus III after his supposed 'death' during the 2017 Popestar Tour, and Papa Emeritus III is the same character as Papa Nihil's successor, Papa Emeritus IV's predecessor, and Tobias Forge's main character. The age of Papa Emeritus III at the time of the album 'Meliora' release is not stated, but on the album's track 'He Is', it is mentioned that Papa Emeritus II is 288 years old. Papa Emeritus III is said to be 9 years younger than Papa Emeritus II, who was 288 years old. Thus, Papa Emeritus III was 288 - 9 = 279 years old. Since the album release was in 2015, we now need to know the current year, which is used to calculate the age difference. Since the current year is 2024, Papa Emeritus II would be 297 years old, and Papa Emeritus III would be 288 years old. However, to calculate their age at the time of the question, we need to know the current year at the time of the question. If the current year at the time of the question was 2023, then Papa Emeritus II would be 296 years old, and Papa Emeritus III would be 287 years old. However, the current year at the time of the question was 2024, so we will use 297 years old and 288 years old, but the difference is the same.
