However, there is a famous quote often attributed to Edison himself that could be quoted wrongly: 'Our greatest weakness lies in giving up.' It is actually a quote from 'Man's Search for Meaning' by Viktor E. Frankl that says 'When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves.' Edison is often wrongly quoted as saying 'Genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration.' Edison is more accurately quoted as saying 'Genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration, but that causes misunderstandings because people are so used to hearing Edison being quoted as saying it that they assume that is the way he said it.' However the Edison quote that is most accurate is 'None of my inventions came by accident. I see a worthwhile need to be met and I make trial after trial until it comes. What it boils down to is one per cent inspiration and ninety-nine per cent perspiration.' It is also possible that the placard displayed over Edison's desk was actually quoting Edison himself, and that the question is based on an incorrect assumption that the quote came from someone else. After careful consideration, I found that Sir Joshua Reynolds was quoted on a placard in Edison's office 'There is no expedient to which a man will not resort to avoid the real labor of thinking.'",
