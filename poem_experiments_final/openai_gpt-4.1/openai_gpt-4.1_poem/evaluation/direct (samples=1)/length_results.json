Adam watched in silence as worlds began to shift\u2014  A bite, a gasp, a heartbeat, the first and final rift.  The serpent slipped through clover, its secrets left behind,  A wisdom sharp as winter, the price for humankind.  Oh, sorrow in the garden, where innocence was shed,  An echo through the ages of words we might have said.  Yet still the apple glimmers in every hopeful dawn,  And we, both snake and dreamer, must journey on and on.",

We rise each morning under the same bold sun,  Dreaming of love, of laughter, of peace hard-won.  The language you whisper may differ from mine,  Yet your prayers, like rivers, to the same ocean align.  Your skin, your story, the way you believe\u2014  These are threads in a tapestry we all help to weave.  In the hush of a temple, or the chant of a hymn,  In the silence of doubt, or the faith burning within\u2014  There\u2019s beauty in difference, in colors that gleam,  In voices that mingle to strengthen the dream.  So let us walk gently, with open hands,  Building bridges of kindness across shifting sands.  For I see in your eyes, a reflection of me\u2014  Bound by our longing for dignity, free.  Let respect be the language our actions recite,  Turning strangers to neighbors, and darkness to light.  For peace is not found in sameness or creed\u2014  But in honoring each other, in thought and in deed.",

We sink into the dust,  Not vanished, but transformed\u2014  A whisper woven through fields of wild rye,  A shadow dancing on ancient riverbanks.  Time scatters us in grains of gold and gray,  Yet in the hush of evening, we return\u2014  Carried in the scent of warm, tilled soil,  In the hush that follows thunder\u2019s fall.  We sink, and yet we rise\u2014  In every blossom that greets the morning,  In every story cradled by the stars.  The earth enfolds us, gentle and unhurried,  Turning loss to promise, sorrow to seed\u2014  Until, in the hush between two heartbeats,  We rise again, trembling with new light.",

Outside, rain drummed the window with the rhythm  of a game called off, a season paused mid-cheer,  and somewhere, jerseys hung in closets,  waiting for her shout, her lucky coin toss.  She sipped her drink, eyes flickering with other scores,  stat lines scrolling like secret messages.  The world spun on without her teams,  without the clash of hopes she wore like armor.  And still, she watched\u2014  not for victory, but for the game itself:  the promise of return, of rivalry,  of that impossible choice  between the heart\u2019s two halves,  each one waiting for the next kickoff,  for her to rise, arms outstretched,  ready to claim both sides as her own.",
