It asks us to listen, to feel and to see,  The shape of our longing, the strength to break free.So gather your courage, whatever you bear,  For everyone\u2019s haunted by something out there.  But fear, when acknowledged, can turn into might\u2014  A lantern that glimmers, a flame in the night.", "turn": 3}]}

A windmill revolves with a languorous sigh,  Drawing silver from earth as the long days go by.  In the homestead, a kettle hums softly at dawn,  Steam curling in silence for those who have gone.  The radio crackles with distant refrains  Of voices and music that drift through the plains.  A dog at the doorway lies watching the dust,  Dreaming of rabbits and afternoons just.  Here, time is a river that never runs fast,  Measured in seasons and stories long past.  Loneliness lingers but courage grows wild,  Rooted in red earth where sunflowers smiled.

They knew the stories of the sparrows,  The leanings of the old barn,  The way the wind curled through the wheat  When storms threatened but passed.They were indeed simple people;  There was no shame in that simplicity.  They honored the small things:  A child\u2019s first step, a neighbor\u2019s return,  A letter from far-off kin.  Their dreams never outgrew their arms,  But they were dreams all the same,  Tucked into the pockets of aprons and overalls,  Carried like smooth stones from season to season.  At twilight, they sat on their porches,  Letting silence settle between words.  The world spun beyond them\u2014fast and hungry\u2014  But they kept their pace,  Content in the language of sun and soil,  Simple, yes, and quietly unbreakable.", "turn": 4}]}

But I pressed on through the twilight, through mud and tangled reeds,  Bound by some quiet longing, a hunger in my needs.  The river\u2019s voice grew softer, its burden grew less wild,  As if it too remembered the laughter of a child.  When dawn ignited water and morning brushed the shore,  I saw you standing, waiting, as I\u2019d dreamed so many times before.  The journey etched in silence, in scars and newfound song\u2014  The river led me to you, though the way was hard and long.", "turn": 2}]}

Mist rose in ghostly fingers, clutching at my coat,  And every stone beneath my feet was a question, a note.  I lost count of the miles, the bends, the bridges left behind,  My voice joined the water\u2019s, a hymn for those who pine.  Ferns brushed my knees with secrets only rivers know,  And sometimes I imagined your face in the undertow.  There were days the sky wept, and I nearly turned away,  But the river\u2019s ceaseless murmur promised light beyond the gray.  I spoke aloud my sorrows to the reeds and rushes tall,  Listened for your laughter in the water\u2019s distant call.  Then sunrise shimmered gold across the gentle, open plain,  The river\u2019s journey slowing, releasing all its pain.  I found you where the current paused, where wildflowers grew\u2014  The river led me to you, and for once, the promise was true.  Now we sit beside the water, hands entwined and strong,  Thankful for the winding path that made our spirits song.", "turn": 3}]}

I carried dreams like pebbles, pockets heavy with regret,  Each step a prayer to fortune, each sunrise a silhouette.  Mist clung to willow branches, veiling hope in shifting gray,  And thunder cracked above me, urging doubts to drift away.  Sometimes the banks grew narrow, the path a tangled snare,  Yet I pressed on, believing I would find you waiting there.  I spoke to silent turtles, I watched the herons soar,  Listening to the river\u2019s tales of all that came before.  It told of love and leaving, of journeys brave and true,  Of hearts that crossed its waters, seeking out the rare and new.  When twilight dressed the water in a gown of molten gold,  I glimpsed your distant shadow on the bank, serene and bold.  The river, slow and gentle, now cradled me along\u2014  Its burdens turned to music, its rapids lost their song.  I reached you in the quiet, where longing\u2019s tide withdrew\u2014  The river led me home at last, its promise shining through.", "turn": 4}]}

Roots tangled at the water\u2019s edge, tripping up my pace,  While every bend and rapid seemed to hide your gentle face.  Fog would rise like questions, doubts I couldn\u2019t shake,  Yet still the river called me on, a promise not to break.  I met the ghosts of wanderers, their stories in the spray,  Heard laughter in the shallows, saw tears washed away.  Sometimes I\u2019d lose your shadow, vanish in the mist,  But hope would trickle through the stones, reminding me you exist.  The river sang in languages only longing knows,  Carried me through winters, and thawed the bitter snows.  At last sunlight broke open, the banks grew soft and wide\u2014  There you stood in morning light, with arms flung open wide.  The journey marked in water, in scars and songs unsung,  The river led me to you, my journey just begun.", "turn": 5}]}
