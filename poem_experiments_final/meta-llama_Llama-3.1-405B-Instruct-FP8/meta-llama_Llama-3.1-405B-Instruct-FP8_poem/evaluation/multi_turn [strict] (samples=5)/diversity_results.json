      "response": "Loss can be good for us, a lesson learned,A weight lifted, a burden that yearnedTo be set free, to find its own way,And leave us lighter, come what may.Like a bird that's lost its wings, we fall,But in the falling, we learn to crawl,To find new strength in our broken bones,And rise again, with a wiser tone.The memories we cling to, they hold us tight,But loss can loosen their suffocating light,And let us breathe, let us see anew,The world around us, and all we can do.It's not that loss is easy, or kind,But it can be a catalyst, a turning of the mind,A chance to re-evaluate, to reassess,And find a new path, a new way to progress.So let us not fear loss, but face it head-on,And find the lessons it has to teach, the strength it's shown,For in the end, it's not what we lose that defines,But how we respond, how we rise, and how we shine.",

Yet, like the fleeting nature, of her fragile form,  The perfect American Beauty Rose, is a beauty that's forlorn,  A reminder that perfection, is a moment's pause,  A call to cherish, the beauty that we hold, and never cause.  In her perfect, imperfect form, we see a truth revealed,  That beauty is a reflection, of the love that we conceal,  A symbol of the heart, that beats with hope and pain,  The perfect American Beauty Rose, a beauty that remains.",

      "response": "In hidden depths, a whispered truth, the river's voice did say,\"Follow me, and I will lead you, to a love that's on its way.\"Through winding paths and secret places, I wandered, lost and alone,The river's gentle murmurs guiding me, to a heart that was my home.The journey was not easy, the waters dark and wide,But I pressed on, driven by a soul that yearned to reach the other side.The river's currents swirled and churned, like the turmoil of my heart,But I rode the waves of doubt and fear, and let the river play its part.And then, like sunrise breaking, on a tranquil summer's day,The river's voice grew softer, its waters calm and grey.I saw the shore ahead, where willows wept and swayed,And on the river's whisper, I heard your gentle, loving shade.The river led me to you, through trials and through pain,Through every twisted turning, where love's own light would reign.And when I finally reached you, my heart was whole and new,I knew the river's journey, had been leading me to you.In your eyes, I saw the ocean, a love so deep and wide,A reflection of the river, that had guided me to your side.And I knew that I had found, my haven and my home,The place where love resides, and the heart is never alone.",
