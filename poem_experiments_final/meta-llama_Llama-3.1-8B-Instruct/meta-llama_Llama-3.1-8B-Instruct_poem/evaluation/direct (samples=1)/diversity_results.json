Memories of joy, now taunt her mind,A bittersweet reminder of what's left behind.She searches for solace, a peaceful place,Where the ache within may slowly erase.But like a shroud, her doubts entwine,A suffocating grip, that chokes the soul's design.In this dark night, she's forced to face,The emptiness within, a hollow, endless space.Still, she lies alone, a fragile thing,A delicate balance, where love and pain cling.And though the darkness may seem to prevail,A glimmer of hope, may yet set her sail.",
