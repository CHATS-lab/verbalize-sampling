His touch, a whisper, that awakens age, and all its faded page. Memories, like morning dew, are lost, and swept away, in his dark pursuit. Yet, in the heart, a spark remains, a flame, that flickers, and still sustains. For though Time steals, with cunning guile, our youthful years, and fleeting smile, he cannot take, the love we hold, the laughter, and the tears.",
