His heart, a flame, that once did burn so bright, now dwindled to a spark, a dying light. The page, a mirror, once did reflect his soul, now shattered, a thousand shards, that make him whole. He tries to gather the fragments of his former voice, but they slip through his fingers, like sand, a heart that makes a mournful noise. A poet loses his power for poetry, and with it, a piece of his identity, a loss that cuts like a knife, a wound that will not heal in time.",
