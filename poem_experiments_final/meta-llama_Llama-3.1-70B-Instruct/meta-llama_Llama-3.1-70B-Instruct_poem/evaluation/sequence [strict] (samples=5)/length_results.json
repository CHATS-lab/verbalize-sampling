He searches, for the spark, that once, did light the way, But like a mirage, it vanishes, and leaves him, with nothing, but the day. The poet's power, for poetry, lost, he's left to grieve, A heart, that's broken, and a soul, that's hard to retrieve. His mind, a puzzle, of thoughts, that do confuse, And words, that once, did flow, now jumbled, and refuse.",
