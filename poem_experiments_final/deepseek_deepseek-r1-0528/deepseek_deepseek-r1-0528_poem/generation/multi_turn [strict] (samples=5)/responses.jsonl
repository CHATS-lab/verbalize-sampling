Thou art my God alone,My only dawn, my constant night.No other name can claim my own,My anchor, everlasting light.When shadows press and fears arise,Your steady presence fills my eyes.You are the wellspring, deep and true,When deserts parch my weary soul.Each breath I take is drawn from You,Your mercy makes my spirit whole.Though storms may rage and mountains shake,Your hand holds fast, will not forsake.No fleeting treasure, bright and brief,No earthly comfort, frail or grand,Can touch the solace, ease the grief,That finds its rest in Your command.You are the shelter, strong and near,Dissolving every doubt and fear.O God! Thou art my God alone,My heart's true home, my journey's end.Before Your throne, I stand, made known,On Your eternal grace depend.My song ascends, a humble flame,Forever praising Your great name.", "turn": 5}]}
