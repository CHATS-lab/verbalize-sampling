You grieve by being here,By holding space, profound and clear,For what is gone, yet still remainsIn whispered winds and autumn rains."}]}

The world keeps turning fast,While yours stands still, a shadow deeply cast.The sun still shines, absurdly bright and clear,On landscapes stripped of meaning, sharp and sheer.How can you express? The tears refuse to fall,A frozen ocean locked behind a wall.The pen lies idle, ink runs cold and dry,The voice retreats, reduced to just a sigh.You wear the loss like heavy, unseen stone,A constant ache felt deep within the bone.A vacant chair, a scent upon the breeze,A thousand echoes whispering through the trees.Expression fails where sorrow carves its track,A silent language only absence speaks back.The heart holds vigil, wordless and profound,For love departed, leaving only groundWhere memories bloom, both bitter and so sweet,The only testament where loss and longing meet."}]}

Hear the wind demand its due,This hollowing, this necessary rue.Out tumble pebbles smoothed by tides of stress,A broken button, polished by duress.Shake pockets inside out, expose the seams,Release the weight of fractured, fading dreams.Let emptiness ring loud, a hollow bell,Where echoes of possession used to dwell.Now listen to the space where clutter stood,The quiet aftermath is understood.Shake out the pockets, let the fragments fly,Make room beneath this vast, expectant sky.For when the lining's bare against the air,Perhaps the call brings something new to bear."}]}
