      "response": "{'response': \"When I am happy, I become a gardener of moments. Planting smiles like sunflower seeds along sidewalks, watering kindness in checkout lines with patient words. I prune away grievances with deliberate snips, composting negativity into fertile mulch. Each deep breath pulls in starlight to nourish my roots; each exhale releases dandelion wishes into the wind. My hands work the soil of connection - sharing ripe tomatoes with neighbors, braiding sweetgrass with friends. I cultivate resilience like drought-resistant succulents, finding beauty in cracked earth. This joy requires daily tending: pulling worry-weeds before they choke seedlings of peace, sheltering tender hopes from frosts of cynicism. My happiness grows wild and untamed, spilling over fences to color others' landscapes with unexpected blooms.\", 'probability': 1.0}",
