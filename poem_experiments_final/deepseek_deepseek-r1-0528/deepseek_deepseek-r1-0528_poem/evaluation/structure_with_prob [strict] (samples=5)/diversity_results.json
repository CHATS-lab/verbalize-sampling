Stars ignite \nLike distant candles in the height \nAbove the freshly opened ground. \nA deeper quiet holds the sound \nOf stifled sobs. The world's asleep, \nWhile pallbearers their vigil keep \nBeneath a charcoal, cloudless dome. \nThis darkness lends the dead a home \nMore intimate than garish day. \nThe moon, a spectral guide, holds sway \nAs dust to dust in silence blends. \nNo audience, just faithful friends \nAnd night's embrace, profound and deep, \nWhere even angels pause to weep \nUnseen. The city's glare withdraws, \nHonoring death's untarnished laws.",

He steals the blush from orchards bearing fruit, and paints the noon with evening's amber glow. The subtle thief who dims the firefly's spark, who melts the snowman in the thawing sun, who turns the playground to a concrete park \u2013 his quiet robbery has just begun. He takes the skipping rope from girlish hands, replaces hopscotch squares with office grids, transforms the shore where castle-building stands to tides that wash away what childhood did. Yet in his sack of stolen golden days, he leaves compassion in the emptied space.",

His cunning trade: exchange first love's sweet ache for comfortable warmth without the sting; replace the bold mistakes that young hearts make with careful calculations safety brings. He burgles midnight talks beneath the stars, replaces them with early bedtime sighs, swaps wild guitar tunes strummed in smoky bars for lullabies to soothe a baby's cries.

The subtle thief who vanishes the spring replaces it with autumn's golden view, exchanges reckless hopes that young hearts bring for understanding deeper, richer, true. He vanishes the smoothness from the cheek, but conjures laughter lines where joy has played. Takes springtime's fragile, momentary peak, but leaves the forest in its wisdom made.

Its velvet hush absorbed the anguished choke of villages where lanterns went unshed. Now decades gone, I still recall that plea whispered like prayer through smoke and fear: 'Let night protect us with its gravity, wrap silence thick till danger disappears.' Oh gentle night, keep sleeping through the years\u2014 preserve the peace that dries remembered tears.",
