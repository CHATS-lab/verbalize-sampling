I simply stand,  a tree with no mission but to be rooted,  and when the wind asks who I am,  I answer with silence  so full,  it sings.",

No net, no savior, only the wind singing an old lullaby in a language my bones remembered. For the first time in my life, I didn\u2019t fight the pull. I let go of the weight I\u2019d worn like armor, the name I\u2019d sharpened into a weapon. I floated, untethered\u2014no map, no mission, just the quiet thrill of being small beneath something infinite. And when I landed, it wasn\u2019t on solid ground, but in the soft certainty that I could break and still belong. That I could tremble and still be true. For the first time, I whispered, *I am here*, and the world didn\u2019t flinch. It leaned in. It answered, *I know. I\u2019ve been waiting.* And for the first time in my life, I believed in welcome.",

I knew the weight of silent rooms,  The grammar of a breaking thing,  How light retires before the gloom  And how the caged bird learns to sing  Not joy, but mimicry of flight\u2014  A hollow tune, a feathered lie,  While in the dark, unseen, the night  Grew roots beneath my ribs and sigh.  They taught me numbers, words, good grace,  To bathe in clocks and wear the sane\u2014  But still I wandered the wild space  Where rain remembers every name.  Now grown, I carry that lost child  Like smoke inside a lantern\u2019s frame:  Not gone, not healed, not reconciled\u2014  Just breathing, whispering my shame  And wonder: if I turned the key,  Would all the locked-up me\u2019s break free?  From childhood\u2019s hour I have not been  The same. But what I am\u2014is more.  A storm that wears a human skin,  And knocks upon the world\u2019s shut door.",

It lived in glances turned aside,  in laughter edged with something torn,  in every time I swallowed pride  to keep the peace, to be \u201cthe good\u201d one.  But now it shapes a different tongue,  one that names the unnamed theft\u2014  the dreams that died before they were sung,  the love that bowed when it should\u2019ve cleft.  This anger is not meant to scar,  but to awaken what\u2019s been buried:  the pulse beneath the mask, the bar  of truth no compromise has carried.  It fuels the walk, the lifted chin,  the no that trembles, then stands still.  It\u2019s not the wound. It is the skin  that forms where all the hurt once spilled.  So let it burn. Let it refine  the dross of years, the false, the thin.  This anger\u2014dark, deliberate, mine\u2014  is not the end. It is the kin  of every seed that cracks the dark  to find, at last, its necessary spark.",

Still, I rise.*  For fear is not always the enemy\u2014  sometimes it is love in ragged clothes,  aching for a seat at the table,  begging not to be forgotten.  My God, how many are my fears\u2014  and still, I set another plate.",

They wear the shape of missed goodbyes,  of letters never sent, of trains too late,  of all the times I held my tongue  while love grew distant, thin as fate.  One fear the sky might fall at dawn,  another whispers I\u2019ll be left behind,  a third insists my voice is dust,  not meant for music, not for rhyme.  They crowd the mirror when I look,  distorting lines I barely know,  they name me fraud, they call me weak,  they feed on every seed of woe.  But then\u2014a hush. A different breath.  Not thunder, but a knocking low,  as if the dark itself leaned near  and murmured, *I have known you so.*  And in that ache, that weighted air,  where every shadow seems too real,  a presence walks among the dread  and names each fear, then calls *my name*\u2014  not to banish, not to shame,  but to sit beside it, calm and slow.  So let them come, these ghostly guests.  Let tremors rise and hearts descend.  My God, how many are my fears\u2014  and how much larger, You, my Friend.",

They shout not for kings or for conquests won,  but for rain that hasn\u2019t fallen in years,  for names remembered when all seemed done,  for laughter that conquers unspoken fears.  The wind takes the cloth, lifts it high\u2014  a thousand sighs turned into flame.  Not victory, but defiance in the sky:  we are here, we remain, we are not the same.  Their flags are made of memory and thread,  their voices, a choir of dust and dawn.  And in that moment, the earth leans in\u2014  as if to say: *You are not alone.*",

War\u2019s a joke\u2014until the mailbox  yawns with silence day by day,  until the chair at dinner stays  forever pulled halfway.  Until the dog still waits at dawn,  ears pricked for steps that won\u2019t return,  and photographs grow heavy hands  that no one dares to burn.  We joked to make it small, you see,  to fit it in a tweet, a rhyme,  to turn the horror into art  and call it *satire* in due time.  But satire doesn\u2019t stitch the lung,  nor does a punchline stem the bleed.  The earth still drinks what we\u2019ve become,  and plants remember every seed.  So yes\u2014call war a punchline,  a farce, a jest, a game.  But when the laughter falters,  and no one calls your name,  when dust becomes your lullaby  and stars are lost to smoke\u2014  the joke becomes a mirror,  and the punchline is your throat.  War's a joke for me and you\u2014  until it learns your voice.  Until it calls you cousin,  and makes you choose.",

I\u2019ve offered them tea and candlelight,  asked them gently to unclench.  Still, they multiply like stars\u2014  cold, distant, burning bright.  But tonight, I speak a different prayer:  not *take them*, Lord, but *walk with them*.  Let me learn their hollow songs,  trace the maps they\u2019ve drawn.  For in their company, I\u2019ve learned this\u2014  fear is not the end of love,  but love\u2019s trembling, breathless twin.  And even trembling can be holy  when met with open hands.

Rewind, not to change, but to witness\u2014  to see how every scar was once a wound,  and every joy, a quiet rebellion.  Remember the way light slants through the trees  in late October,  golden and fleeting.  Now breathe forward.  Carry the echoes.

You slip in like moonlight through a crack in the cellar,  or rise like steam from the cup I thought had gone cold.  You do not demand to be proclaimed,  only permitted\u2014  to curl in the vowels of my hesitation,  to warm the hollows where fear once nested.  So I will not chase you with torches.  I will sit.

It is the pulse beneath the skin,  the compass needle trembling toward what matters.  It guards the doors of the heart,  not to lock them, but to ask:  *Are you ready? Are you brave?*  And when we walk forward anyway,  trembling, breath caught,  that is not weakness\u2014  that is the quiet thunder  of living despite the dark.  Everyone has a fear.  And everyone, in their own hushed way,  carries it like a flame through wind,  refusing to let the light go out.",

Some fear fire, the way it licks the air,  others fear water, how it holds and doesn\u2019t let go.  A child fears the thunder\u2019s sudden crack,  the way the house seems to flinch.  A grown man fears the phone that won\u2019t ring,  the silence where a voice used to live.  There are fears of falling,  and fears of never rising.  Fears of being seen\u2014  the exposure of skin and truth,  the shame of wanting too much.  And fears of being unseen,  of walking through rooms  where no eyes catch yours,  where your name gathers dust.  The artist fears the blank canvas,  the writer the empty page,  not because they\u2019re empty,  but because they\u2019re full of ghosts\u2014  of what could be,  of what might fail.  But here\u2019s the secret whispered in midnight breath:  fear is not the opposite of courage.  It is its companion,  its shadow twin.  It means something matters.  It means the heart still knows how to tremble.  So when the old fear rises\u2014  the one with your face,  the one that calls your name in dreams\u2014  do not curse it.  Look it in the eye.  Say: *I see you.  But I\u2019m walking anyway.*  For everyone has a fear,  but not everyone lets it teach them  how to love the light.",

Some fear the scream caught in the throat,  others, the silence that answers when they call.  The woman on the train fears the edge,  not because she wants to fall,  but because she wonders what it would mean  to stop holding on at all.  The boy with stars in his palms fears growing up,  not because childhood is safe,  but because the world demands he trade wonder  for a wallet and a fixed address.  A mother fears the school bell,  the absence of small feet at the gate.  A son fears his father\u2019s hands,  not for what they\u2019ve done, but what they might.  Some fear love\u2014the way it demands surrender,  the risk of being known, truly known.  Others fear indifference,  the slow freeze of being forgotten  before the body even stops.  But fear is not always a chain.  Sometimes it\u2019s the first breath before song,  the shiver before warmth returns.  It maps the borders of what we cherish.  So when your fear wakes you at 3 a.m.,  don\u2019t silence it.  Ask: *What are you guarding?*  And in its trembling voice,  you might hear the shape of your courage  beginning to form.  Everyone has a fear.  And in that trembling,  we are not alone.  We are human\u2014  aching, fragile,  and still choosing to step forward.",

No cattle low in the sun-cracked paddocks\u2014  only the scuttle of lizards and the sigh of spinifex,  bowing to winds that carry no news,  only the old ache of distance.  Here, a woman once planted roses  in red earth that gave nothing back.  They lasted one spring\u2014pink flames  licked out by drought and silence.  Now their thorns remain,  twisted sentinels around a well with no water,  its stones etched with initials  no living hand can name.  At dusk, the light slants gold and cruel,  gilding the ruin, pretending it\u2019s still loved.  A swag lies rolled beneath the verandah,  stuffed with letters never sent.  And sometimes, when the moon hangs low  like a lantern over dead timber,  you might hear it\u2014  the ghost of a fiddle,  a tune half-remembered,  played on a porch where no one sits,  by a man who stayed too long  to be called a dreamer,  too long to be called anything at all.  This is where stories go to dry up,  where love turns to duty,  and duty to dust.  A single crow calls\u2014  not for company,  but to prove the silence  is real.",

At dawn, she pours tea for two,  leaves one cup cooling on the sill.

A thousand cloth wings rise\u2014dyed with saffron hopes,  indigo lullabies, the green of fields once burned  and now breathing again.  They wave not to claim the sky,  but to fill it with the colors of return:  the exile coming home with only a suitcase and a song,  the child spelling her name in a language  no longer forbidden.  The shout is not a battle cry,  but the sudden laughter of a people  who thought their voices were lost\u2014  now rising, tangled together like vines on a rebuilt wall.  An old man holds a scrap of fabric stitched decades ago,  before the silence, before the running.  He doesn\u2019t speak, but the banner flutters like a pulse.  It says: *We were here. We are still here.*  And the wind carries it\u2014  not as warning, not as threat,  but as gift:  a flutter of cloth over a schoolyard,  a ribbon tied to a newly planted tree,  a promise that joy, too,  can be an act of courage.  So let them wave.  Let the air tremble with color and chorus.  For every flag unfurled is a breath  refused to be stolen.  A heart, wide open,  saying:  *I exist.  I remember.  I celebrate anyway.*",

He came with a Bible, a spade, and a wife who sang to seedlings like lullabies could summon rain. They called it *New Eden*, though the earth gave back only thistles and the echo of wind through eaves.  Years wore the doorframe low with absence. The dog died, then the garden, then the hope that wagons would come, that children would laugh, that the horizon wasn\u2019t just a wall dressed in mirage.  Now, only the ironweed remembers her voice. The wind stirs letters half-buried in silt\u2014ink fading like memory. *\u201cDearest, the nights are long but I keep the lamp\u2014\u201d* and there it stops.  No train ever passed. No town bloomed in the distance. Just silence, thick as sage after storm, and the slow return of wild things\u2014coyotes nosing through the hearth, owls nesting in the rafters where hymns once rose.  Yet in spring, a single peach tree\u2014gnarled, unbidden\u2014blooms defiant pink against the grey. A pulse in the dust. A yes in the mouth of no.  And the stars, ancient and indifferent, write their cold poems overhead, unaware they are witnessed\u2014by a tree, by a ghost, by the wind turning one more page in the book of what endures.",

The house, low and hunched, wears its sag like grief. No child's laugh has tangled in the eaves in decades. The porch holds only a splintered chair and the ghost of rocking.  Once, boots paced this dust, worn thin with waiting. A woman stood here, hands knotted at her apron, watching the trail that never curved with visitors. She planted roses. They grew thorned and shy, blooming one pale pink burst before surrendering to sand.  The well still holds water, dark and cold, tasting of stone and forgotten vows. At night, the moon pours silver into the bucket, and the stars lean close, as if listening for echoes\u2014of prayer, of argument, of a lullaby hummed through tears.  Now, only the kangaroo rats remember. They dart through shattered glass, past a rusted stove and a doll\u2019s arm buried in the dirt. The wind turns the calendar nailed to the wall\u2014page after page of blank years\u2014while the horizon stays sealed, a vow unkept.  But sometimes, when the breeze drops, and the silence thickens like cooled ash, you might hear it: a single note rising, not from the windmill, not from memory, but from the land itself\u2014soft, persistent, singing back to the sky in a language older than loneliness.",

She drank from it\u2014hands chapped, eyes scanning the horizon not for love, but for rain.

But listen\u2014beneath the silence, beneath the sigh of spinifex and the cry of a distant curlew\u2014there\u2019s a pulse. Not of regret, but of presence. The land does not mourn the dream; it absorbs it. Like water into stone. Like a name into the breath of the world.  And when the first star pierces the violet hush, it does not shine for the lost. It shines for the staying. For the stubborn light that flickers, even here, in the vast, unyielding West.",

Its teeth are still clenched on the taste of thistle and thirst, its hollow sockets turned east\u2014toward a rain that never came.  The tracks leading in outnumber those leading out. One set, deep and dragging, ends at the doorstep of a cabin with no door. Inside, a ledger lies open on a table of warped pine. Entries stop in June. *\"Drought continues. God if You're listening\u2014\"* and then nothing. Not even a signature.  The wind pages through it now, turning brittle sheets like a scholar of sorrows. It carries the scent of sun-baked leather, of roots burning in a cold stove, of a woman\u2019s hair once braided with blue thread, now dust in the seams of the floor.  At night, the stars drape low, spilling silver over rusted traps and a child\u2019s shoe, rooted in soil. The moon watches, impassive, as shadows gather\u2014not ghosts, but echoes: a fiddle\u2019s last note, a whispered argument, a name called across fields that answered only with heat.  Yet in the dawn\u2019s first hush, before the wind resumes its reign, a single note rises\u2014thin, clear\u2014from the throat of a wren perched on the skull\u2019s brow. It sings not of loss, but of light. Of how life, small and fierce, returns to sing on the bones of the broken, in the hush where dreams went to rest. And the West, vast and unsoftened, listens\u2014not in pity, but in kinship.",

He came without a banner, yet the wind turned still.  No crown\u2014only the weight of a name older than Rome.  The sword was in His silence when the money-changers fell,  in the way He named the liar, loved the one in hell.  This blade divides the heart that clings to comfort and control,  cuts through the hymns we sing to mask the hollow in the soul.  It parts the disciple trembling on the edge of faith,  from the one who laughs and sells the night for thirty scraps of grace.  Not peace that lulls, but peace that burns\u2014  a fire in the bones of those who mourn.  For where the sword has carved the dark,  a truer light is born.  It cleaves the family\u2014mother turned from daughter\u2019s creed,  not for wrath, but for the seed  that dies to rise, that breaks to feed.  The peace He brings is not the hush of undisturbed deceit,  but resurrection thunder in the clefts of grief and heat.  So let the sword descend. Let every false foundation crack.  What shatters in His name comes whole when laid upon the rack.  For love wields no softer weapon\u2014  and no greater tact\u2014  than a sword that cuts to save.",

The sword was not of iron, but of breath and burning word,  a silence sharp as lightning, every hollow creed unstirred.  No crown of gold or lilies\u2014His head was bowed and low,  yet in His shadow stretched the edge where false foundations go.  He did not raise an army, nor summon flame or storm,  but split the calm complacency with a still, unyielding form.  The blade cut through the marketplace, where mercy had been priced,  divided friend from family when love had paid the price.  A son turned from his father not in rage, but in grief,  for truth had drawn the boundary beyond the realm of ease.  It wasn\u2019t war He brought us\u2014no banners, no decree\u2014  but war *within* the spirit, the battle to be free:  free from the peace that whispers, \u201cLet suffering pass unseen,\u201d  free from the hymns that comfort while justice bleeds between.  The sword remains in whispers\u2014in hands that choose the right,  in shelters lit by courage, in standing through the night.  Not peace that hushes prophets, nor sleep beneath the chain,  but peace that dares to wound first, so love may heal the pain.  So He returns each morning in those who break the sword  not to destroy, but forge it into plowshares, singing word\u2014  and still the choice is given: to cleave, or to be whole\u2014  Christ comes not with peace, but with a sword\u2026 and a mending of the soul.",

So mourn if you must the untroubled past,  but bless the snake for its wisdom that lasts,  and her, the first mind to choose the real\u2014  the flawed, the felt, the raw, the healed.  The tale is sorry, yes\u2014but not for the sin.  For how long we\u2019ve punished the courage to begin.",

The wind, once heavy with silence, now carries a chorus of names\u2014  Mothers, sons, dreamers\u2014etched in flame, no longer bound by chains.  They wave not for conquest or kingdom, nor for soil claimed in blood,  But for the fragile, fierce right to stand, to speak, to be understood.  Each banner holds a story: a village lost, a river crossed,  A child\u2019s first word in a new tongue, a father\u2019s life, not lost, but tossed  Like a seed into the unknown, now sprouting green and wide.  They shout not in anger, but in awe\u2014they\u2019ve survived, they\u2019ve survived.  The colors blur like watercolors in the rain of a long drought,  Purple for memory, gold for hope, white for what time wore out.  And high above, where silence once reigned, a single bird takes flight,  Not fleeing, but joining\u2014its wings a flag in the newborn light.  So let them wave. Let the fabric dance like hands that finally speak.  For joy, when it rises from the depths, is the loudest, truest creed.  And every shout, every ripple, every voice flung to the sky\u2014  Is a promise: *We are here. We are many. We will not die.*",

The smallest dreamed of flight without wings,  of drifting on air like a seed, like a sigh.  When they left, the branches trembled  but did not break.  I stood beneath the hollow,  listening to absence hum its old tune.  Now I find their feathers in doorways,  in pockets of coats, tucked in books\u2014  each one a letter I never wrote,  a language of letting go.  And sometimes, in the hush before dawn,  I hear them circling some far ridge,  not returning, but calling my name  not as a plea, but as a note held  in the throat of the wind\u2014  proof that love, once loosed,  becomes sky.",

It held a mirror made of frost,  and showed me faces I had been:  the boy who loved what love had lost,  the man who locked the door on kin.  It said, *You think the light redeems,  but grace is born in falling through.  The night remembers all your dreams\u2014  it tends them while the world sleeps new.*  I asked how long such dark would last,  and it smiled with someone else\u2019s eyes.  *The night is first,* it breathed, *and last.  All dawns are just disguises.*  Then silence sealed the sky again.  No trace of footfall, flame, or cry.  But deep within my quiet vein,  a darker kindness learned to lie.  For now, when shadows stretch and call,  I do not turn. I do not flee.  One night taught me the dark holds all\u2014  even the ghost of who I could be.",

You drag the night by golden chains,  Announce the hour, stir city lanes,  Yet dare to kiss her drowsy cheek\u2014  That light is ours, not yours to speak.  Go tell late courtiers their hour is near,  Or wake sour clerks with ledgers drear.  Chase merchants through the dusty square,  Set anxious students pacing there.  But we, who\u2019ve burned with truer fire,  Outshine your weak, impersonal pyre.  Love has no calendar, no chime,  No debt to rhythm, mode, or time.  The world you wake is cold, half-lit,  While ours is built on breath and wit\u2014  On tangled sheets and murmured names,  On slow goodbyes and stolen games.  You think your blaze can rival this?  The way her palm fits into his?  That gilded eye, so bold, so wide,  Cannot see what love hides\u2014  The universe in half-shut eyes,  A thousand dawns in one soft sigh.  So wander off, old busy fool,  We break no law by breaking school  Of sunrise, noon, or setting gun.  We rise by something older\u2014*one*.  And when you fade, as all stars do,  Love will still be waking you.",

For dawn is not just light returned,  but courage draped in gauzy gray\u2014  a chance to face what we have burned,  and rise, renewed, to meet the day.  Refreshing dawn mist, crisp air\u2014  the earth begins, and so do I,  unwritten, raw, and open there  beneath the vast, forgiving sky.",

Lovers are kings, and need no light  But what ignites in clutch and sigh.  Your empire ends where eyelids close,  And time dissolves in soft repose.

Loss strips us of clutter\u2014  the false urgency, the need to be seen,  the illusion that we control the weather of our lives.  It teaches the body to breathe  even when the heart resists.  It shows us who truly stays\u2014  not those who offer platitudes,  but the ones who sit beside us  in the dim room,  saying nothing,  being everything.  And slowly,  like roots finding their way through rock,  we grow around the absence.  Not forgetting.  Not replacing.  But becoming wider,  deeper,  more tender\u2014  able to hold both grief and gratitude  in the same trembling hand.  Loss does not bless.  But it reveals:  we are more vast  than what we\u2019ve lost.  And in that vastness,  we learn  how to return  to life\u2014  not as we were,  but as we are:  scarred,  softened,  stunningly alive.",

Loss strips the theater from life.  No more pretending we\u2019re invincible.  No more hoarding tomorrow.  And in that nakedness,  we find a strange kind of gift\u2014  a clarity sharp as frost,  a courage that doesn\u2019t roar,  but breathes.

Sky: pale ochre, no clouds bartering rain,  only dust riding thermals above the ruins.  Temperatures rising\u2014hope hovers at 35\u00b0C,  but feels like longing in the bones.  No precipitation expected, though eyes glisten  at the scent of wet earth from a dream.  In Shahr-e Naw, a man checks his phone\u2014  \"Partly sunny, chance of calm\"\u2014  as if peace could be scheduled,  as if silence weren\u2019t just the pause between blasts.  Wind from the west: carries chalk dust from schoolyards,  a torn page from a poetry book,  the echo of a name called at a checkpoint.  Gusts may increase at dusk,  when shadows stretch like questions.  Tonight: clear. Stars sharp as shrapnel.  The moon, a sliver of forgotten silver,  watches over rooftops where families whisper  over tea, reheating yesterday\u2019s bread.  No frost, but the heart knows cold\u2014  the kind that seeps through walls,  not from weather, but waiting.  No official warning for nostalgia,  for the sudden warmth when a child laughs  in a language older than war.  No radar for relief,  but someone plants marigolds in a shell case,  and the forecast shifts\u2014  not on any screen,  but in the quiet breath of Kabul  learning to exhale.",

Not just the blaze that splits timber and scrolls,  but the glow in the belly of clay  when the potter breathes into her hands.  It is the red eye in the stove at 3 a.m.,  watching the widow stir her tea,  her grief a slow simmer,  her love still alight.  Fire is the first lie we told the dark\u2014  *We are not afraid.*  And the truth we whisper back:  *I am so cold.*  It rides the struck match,  the flint on steel,  the friction of two stones  kissing after centuries apart.  It lives in the welder\u2019s arc,  stitching steel like silver thread,  in the candle cupped behind trembling fingers  in a hospital chapel,  in the screen where a lover\u2019s face flickers  across continents, pixel-soft,  burning with distance.  Even in ice, it waits\u2014  coiled in the core of the earth,  in the seed that remembers summer,  in the silence between heartbeats  where courage gathers.  Fire does not forgive.  It transforms.  Ash is not an end\u2014  it is the alphabet of what grows next.  So when the wind dies  and the night thickens,  I strike the match,  not to destroy,  but to say:  *Here.  I am still here.  And I carry the spark.*",

Fire is the first word  our ancestors shaped with cracked lips,  not for war, not for warmth,  but to name the thing  that danced in the hollow of night  and did not eat them.  It is the pilot light beneath the stove,  flickering through decades of soup and silence,  the candle on a birthday cake  where a child\u2019s breath trembles\u2014  not to extinguish, but to measure  how long love can burn.  It lives in the welder\u2019s mask,  the forge of a blacksmith\u2019s prayer,  in the red glow of brakes  on a winter hill,  in the screen of a phone  in the dark, lighting a face  reading a message that says *I miss you*\u2014  a small fire sent across wires.  Fire does not care if you believe.  It existed before myth,  will outlast every god.  It does not judge the hand that kindles\u2014  only answers the call.

Fire is the welder\u2019s eye, narrowed behind glass, guiding molten thread through steel\u2019s wound. It is the red coil beneath the teapot, humming a hymn to patience.  It does not forgive the moth, but it does not gloat. It takes the log, the paper, the oil, and gives back only light and the alphabet of ash. It danced on the pyre of saints, on the torches of mobs, on the candles held aloft in stadiums singing the same word over and over\u2014*love, love, love*\u2014as if repetition could make it true.  Fire is the first tool, the first companion, the first betrayal when it leaps the hearth. It cooks the meal, chars the bread, burns the hand that stirs the pot.

And when all is cold, it waits\u2014  in the coal\u2019s dark heart,  in the seed beneath snow,  in the glance across a room  that says, *I see you,*  and ignites the air between.

Kiss the wound that never closes, kiss the song that won\u2019t be sung,  kiss the clock that\u2019s stopped at midnight, where the past and future\u2019ve run.  Go, go\u2014where the world is paper and the rules are written thin,  kiss the edge of every border, let the chaos tumble in.  Kiss the liar\u2019s trembling lashes, kiss the truth behind his lies,  kiss the moment just before love becomes sacrifice.  Go, go\u2014not for glory, not for pardon, not for praise,  but because the air is thick with almosts, and the night is full of maybes.  Kiss the storm, the scorch, the freeze, kiss the ash and kiss the spark,  kiss the dark not out of terror, but because you left your mark.  So run, my wild one, unrepentant, with fire tucked inside your sleeve\u2014  go, go, and kiss the edge of dawn,  go, go, and kiss belief.",

No titles marked them, no immortal piece  Of schoolyard myth, no laurel, no disdain  Had yet taken root. Just fields of fescue gold,  And whispered codes beneath the dorm\u2019s dim glow,  Where futures flickered, fragile, half-untold,  And every laugh was both a shield and bow.

Here, mischief wore no mask, but stood half-naked\u2014  Honest as grass, as sharp as splintered glass.  And in that pause, where no allegiance ached,  The seeds of loyalty began to pass  From glance to glance, like sparks across dry hay.  No war was waged, yet every skirmish loomed.  This prelude\u2014soft, insistent\u2014would one day  Be myth. But now, it simply was: a room  Of boys, a dusk, a dare not yet confessed,  The fragile prologue to the unconfessed.",

No rain in the forecast,  but the air feels heavy,  like grief held just below the surface.  By midday: scattered clouds,  or was that smoke?  Hard to tell the difference  when the horizon blinks.

Nightfall: sudden, as if the sky  pulls a blanket over its own face.  Stars appear, indifferent and bright,  counted by poets, ignored by missiles.  Low of 52\u00b0F.  Dreams are unstable\u2014  a father wakes gasping,  reaching for a son already gone.  No advisories issued.  No warnings for memory.  For the way a smell\u2014rosewater, gunpowder\u2014  can collapse years in a breath.  In Kabul, the forecast isn\u2019t read\u2014  it\u2019s lived in layers:  beneath the skin, beneath the stone,  beneath every careful step  on ground that remembers  everything it has swallowed.  Tomorrow? Same sky.  Same silence.  Same fragile, stubborn light  creeping back,  as if the world  could still be saved  by the mere act  of beginning again.",

No medals gleam, no portraits mark  The truest deeds beneath the dark.  Just scuffed shoes, a shared cigar,  And maps drawn near where no stars are.  Before the khaki, blood, or drum,  The empire feeds on what they\u2019ve become\u2014  Not soldiers yet, but something slighter:  The architects of being lighter,  Of slipping through with grins and scars\u2014  The prelude played in minor stars.",

A lifted brow, a forged excuse, a prank that blooms in slow deceit\u2014  Each act a stitch in finer cloth, a mind too restless to be beat.  This is the prelude: not a song of innocence or bright-eyed cheer,  But of the boy who learns too soon the cost of being clever here.  Where duty drones and honor\u2019s taught with canes and cold authoritarian breath,  They forge instead a different code\u2014the grammar of avoiding death  By boredom, blindness, blind command. They stalk the halls like quiet spies,  Collecting weaknesses like stamps, watching empires in the eyes  Of men who think they rule the roost, but don\u2019t see how the currents shift\u2014  How laughter, timed, can crack the crust of every pompous, proud gift.  So let the anthem play its part. The future\u2019s not in flags or ranks,  But in the smirk that starts it all\u2014the prelude to the silent pranks  That shape the men who\u2019ll lead, deceive, and never quite believe the lie\u2014  Born in the hush of classrooms where the stalkers learn to walk by stealth, and sigh.",

The bell rings not for joy, but time\u2014time shaped by rigid gears,  Where knowledge is a weapon used to mask what no one hears:  The whispered plot, the swapped exam, the pin stuck in a seat,  Small revolutions, neatly done, where justice feels so sweet.  This is the prelude\u2014not to peace, nor childhood\u2019s gentle play,  But to the age when cunning wears the uniform of day.

No fanfare heralds them,  only the low hum of anticipation,  like thunder before a storm  that refuses to apologize for raining.  They will not save kingdoms.  But they will, for a fleeting season,  make fools of those who forget  that boys grow wilder when caged.  And long after the uniforms are hung up,  the legend will linger\u2014  not in trophies, but in laughter  echoing down the halls,  just before the door slams shut.",

The master paces, monocle agleam,  oblivious to the undercurrent, the private, plotting dream  of boys who trade in irony like currency and creed,  whose loyalty is laughter, and whose power is to lead  not armies, but the ambush of a well-placed, cutting phrase,  the art of making prefects look ridiculous in haze  of smoke from contraband cigars, of ink-smeared, forged replies\u2014  a grammar of resistance dressed in public-school disguise.  They do not speak of courage, yet their courage is precise:  to mock the mask of solemnity, to undermine with ice-  cold mimicry, to turn the rule to joke, the joke to law,  and navigate the tyranny of tradition without awe.

No storm could claim them all, though waves did try\u2014  They slipped through tempests like forgotten sighs.

I chased the sun and thought the dusk would wait,  But shadows stretch with unrelenting grace,  And now I count the weight of every date,  Each one a stone upon love\u2019s resting place.  Yet in this theft, a gift the thief has sown\u2014  Not gold, nor flesh, but wisdom overgrown.  For though he steals the bloom, the fire, the breath,  He leaves behind the quiet taste of depth.  So let him come. I\u2019ll greet him not with dread,  But thanks for all the life that time has said.",

The boy who raced the wind on summer\u2019s edge  Now walks with pockets full of absent names,  His laughter folded, weathered by the pledge  That nothing stays the same, and all life flames  Then fades\u2014not gone, but woven into air,  A breath within the trees, a ghost of prayer.  Yet Time, for all his stealth and quiet theft,  Cannot unwrite the love that roots remain;  Though faces blur and fragile moments left  Are swallowed by the tide, they rise again\u2014  In children\u2019s eyes, in songs half-remembered,  In autumn light that lingers, soft and deep.  He steals the skin, the step, the word untempered,  But not the echoes that the heart will keep.  So let him come. Let seasons slip and bend.  What\u2019s taken is transformed, not lost, in end.",

The trench is filled with quiet moss now,  Barbed wire draped in morning dew.  No shout, no blast to split the stillness\u2014  Only light, soft-stepping through.  Your helmet holds a nest of sparrows,  Your rifle sprouts a fragile vine.  The war you knew has turned to story,  Yet echoes in your spine.  You dreamt of honor, sharp and blazing,  Of banners raised on fields of flame.  But peace arrived in small arrivals\u2014  A wren\u2019s call, a child\u2019s name.  The medals rust in attic darkness,  Forgotten in a cedar chest.  But here, where silence speaks the loudest,  Your weary heart may learn to rest.  The sun does not salute or conquer\u2014  It merely rises, slow and wide,  Touching every scarred remainder  With grace it needs not to provide.  So rise, not as a man at attention,  But as a soul the dawn has found.  Let go the weight of endless duty\u2014  You are not needed now. You\u2019re home.  Soldier, wake\u2014the day is peeping.  The war is over.  You may weep.  You may live.  You may simply be.",

No bugle sounds, no drill, no fight\u2014  Just dew upon a rusted bed  Of helmets turned to flowerpots,  Of boots now rooted in the loam.

No statute carved in courthouse stone,  no judge in robes of black and gold,  can halt the story roots have told  in languages the earth calls home.  It moves in tides of spore and seed,  in fungi stitching under snow,  in how the wounded learn to go  on limping toward the light they need.  There is a law the powerful miss\u2014  it hums in lullabies half-sung,  in hands that cradle what\u2019s been stung,  in every act of tenderness.  It does not flinch at walls or wire,  but seeps through cracks in silence made,  where dreams the world has disavowed  still breathe beneath the mud and mire.  No empire built on dust and dread  can outlast dandelions unasked,  no hunger choked, no hope unmasked,  can kill the will to lift the head.  So when the loud machines decree  that order means to dominate,  remember: love arrives by late  and quiet reclamation.  There is a law\u2014soft, fierce, and old\u2014  that guarantees, when all seems lost,  the world is shaped not by the cost,  but by the hands that hold.",

The moon still climbs, but he no longer greets it with verses. His journal lies open\u2014pages pale as winter skin\u2014yet no word dares to land. He blames time, or age, or love gone cold, but the truth hums beneath: he has stopped believing in magic, and poetry is only magic dressed in breath. He attends readings where younger voices ignite the dark, and he claps, smiling, though something inside fractures with each perfect line. One night, he burns old manuscripts, watching embers spiral like fireflies fleeing a tomb. But from the cinders, a single phrase rises, unasked: *\u201cGrief is just love with nowhere to go.\u201d* He freezes. Not a poem\u2014no meter, no artifice\u2014just truth, raw and uninvited. The next morning, he writes nothing. Instead, he walks barefoot through dew-heavy grass, feeling each blade press against his skin. He does not name it. He does not shape it. But he carries it\u2014this quiet, trembling fullness\u2014like a secret, like a seed. And though no verse follows, the world, somehow, feels spoken.",

Your boots are full of yesterday\u2014  Of mud, of blood, of broken song.  You dreamt of fields, of children\u2019s play,  And woke to where you don\u2019t belong.  The wind carries a telegram  Unopened in your trembling hand.  It smells of home, of lilac, lamb\u2014  A life you can no longer stand  To remember, for it burns too true.  Yet stir you must. The shadows creep  Not just across the sky, but *through*  The cracks where sorrow runs too deep.  A sparrow hops on barbed wire bent,  A stitch of life in war\u2019s long seam.  You rise\u2014not strong, not confident\u2014  But because hope is not a dream,  It\u2019s habit. Breath. A stubborn knee  That pushes up from frozen ground.  The world won\u2019t wait. It asks no plea.  No glory here. No victor\u2019s crown.  Just one more dawn, one aching breath,  One step to prove you\u2019re not yet gone.  So soldier, wake\u2014defy the death  That lingers in the peeping dawn.  Not for flag, nor for command,  But for the fragile, stubborn stand  Of light that dares to reappear\u2014  And for the man who\u2019s still right here.",

Not written down, but lived, begun  each time we choose the light\u2014the one  small act that says, though all may bend,  we'll love, and rise, and try again.",

And I bow, not in worship of your way,  but in reverence that you walk it  with courage,  with grace,  with faith  that refuses to hate me  for walking mine.",

No need to scour the shadows for truth,  nor beg the void for a sign.  Some answers come only in stillness,  woven through the fabric of time.  So still your feet. Still your mind.  Lay down the weight of your years.  Let the night sleep, and while it does,  disappear, disappear.",

Now, even love feels literal\u2014two bodies, no sonnet. His mind, once a storm of imagery, has gone still, like a lake choked with leaves. He writes a line: *I am empty.* But even that feels like theft from better poets. The moon rolls its eyes. Inspiration has packed its bags, left no address. He walks through markets, museums, hospitals\u2014so much life, so little lyric. Then, an old woman feeds pigeons with fists of crumbs, humming off-key. A boy presses his nose to a bookstore window. Rain begins\u2014soft, insistent, spelling nothing. And in the quiet collapse of his need to name it, he feels something rise: not a poem, not a vision, but a presence. Raw. Unwritten. Unwriteable. Perhaps poetry was never in the crafting, but in the surrender\u2014 the moment the poet stops mining beauty and simply stands, breathless, in its ruins. He picks up his pen, not to conquer silence, but to kneel before it. And in that humility, the first true word in years trembles\u2014 not on paper, but in his bones, waiting.",

Even the wind has learned to tiptoe,  carrying nothing but the scent of pine,  and the distant, drowsy chime  of a bell no hand has rung.  This is the hour of return\u2014  not to place, but to pulse,  to the hush beneath the blood,  to the quiet where the self feels least,  and is most.  Let the night sleep.  Let it dream of rivers, roots, and wings.  And if you wake, do not rise\u2014  just listen.  The dark is humming  your oldest, truest name.  Let it sleep.  Let it sing.  Let it hold you  as you forget  and remember  everything.",

Unsettled: that is how we grow\u2014  not in the fortress, but the breach.  Not where the frozen rivers flow,  but where the thaw begins to teach  that breaking is a kind of birth,  and chaos, sometimes, sings of worth.  So let the familiar crack and bend.

It is the exile, cold and stark,  the silence after words grow dark,  the hour when all beliefs take flight,  and shadows stretch across the night\u2014  that cracks the shell where spirit sleeps,  and stirs the dust where vision creeps.  The settled mind, like stagnant air,  forgets the weight and wonder of prayer,  the ache that pulls the compass true,  the wound that lets the sky break through.  Only when sure foundations sway  does courage rise to meet the day.  We are not shaped by standing ground,  but by the slip, the lost, the drowned  who claw toward an unknown shore,  who name the stars they\u2019ve never known.  The map is drawn by those who\u2019ve strayed,  by hands that trembled, unafraid.  So let the old world fall apart.  Let every answer break the heart.  For in the fracture, in the fall,  something ancient dares recall  that peace was never meant to last\u2014  only the search is built to last.  Be unheld. Be unwhole.  Let chaos carve a truer soul.  Only in unrest, in wild and thin,  does the seed of becoming begin.  And only then\u2014unmoored, undone\u2014  does the light finally enter the sun.",

No velvet tongues, no gilded lies,  but laughter loud beneath grey skies.  They cursed the frost, they sang the flame,  and loved too fiercely to play the tame.  Their words were wind through barley rows,  their tears like rain on winter snows.  They broke their backs but kept their pride,  with ghosts and gods they carried inside.  He spoke of ploughmen turned to flame,  who whispered verse no scholars name\u2014  who saw the moon as something known,  a silent friend, a cracked white stone.  And in his voice, a low refrain,  like bagpipes moaning through the rain:  That kindness wears a calloused face,  and truth is born in time and space\u2014  not in the hall, but on the moor,  where men still knock at heaven\u2019s door  with boots of clay and breath of storm,  unbowed, unbroken, keeping warm  the embers of a simple line:  *All men are kings beneath the hawthorn\u2019s sign.*",

And when the fire began to fade,  they sang\u2014not weeping, but in praise\u2014  of love that walks in working shade,  and glory worn in common days.  For Burns had shown, in rhyme and rage,  the crown that every back can bear:  not silk or throne, but stubborn age,  and breath still fierce in broken air.",

And when they died, no bells were rung,  no marble marked their resting ground.  Just wind through thorn, a lark once sung,  and verses circling, low and profound.

No scholars clad in velvet thought  could match the wisdom in their tread\u2014  each step a psalm, each silence loud  with ghosts of all the unsaid.  They ploughed the fields with broken songs,  their women wept in doorways bare,  yet laughter burst like sudden sun  through coal-dust hair and frozen air.  They cursed the lairds, they loved in haste,  their fists were fists, their hearts were doors\u2014  unlocked by whisky, loss, or verse,  by midnight stars and Gaelic wars.  Burns saw the fire in the grime,  the poet caged in labour\u2019s frame,  and gave their rage a golden tongue,  their sorrow an immortal name.  So let the world keep polished men  with measured words and calm replies\u2014  I\u2019d choose the ones who bleed and sing,  whose truth is written in cracked skies,  who stand, though bent by time and toil,  like thistles proud in bitter ground\u2014  not soft, not sweet, but fiercely free,  the rough-hewn pulse of all that\u2019s found  when dignity wears no crown at all,  but walks in boots through mud and mire\u2014  still singing, still defying dust,  still fanning embers into fire.  He spoke of Burns: and in that voice,  the common man became the muse\u2014  not tamed, not trimmed, but wild and vast,  and blazing with unyielding use.",

Yet in their throats, a rebel hymn\u2014  not sweet, but sharp as driven rain,  a pulse beneath the ache and pain  that would not bow, would not grow dim.  They were no poets in silk or lace,  but brawlers, dreamers, lovers, thieves,  who wept for joy between their sleeves  and carved their truth on time\u2019s cold face.  One said, \u201cThe best-laid schemes gang aft agley,\u201d  and laughed as empires turned to rust;  another kissed a lass in trust,  though both were bound to die someday.  They knew the sting of hunger\u2019s whip,  the weight of lies from kirk and crown,  yet raised their cups and brought the town  alive with songs that dared to rip  through silence. Not for gold or fame\u2014  but *feeling*, raw and unrefined:  the ache of leaving, love confined,  the glory in a flawed man\u2019s name.  So when he spoke of Burns that night,  the room grew thick with ghostly breath.  Not polished legends, but men who *died*\u2014  and live because they *lived* in rhyme.  For every soul who\u2019s rough, undone,  who stumbles, fights, and still believes\u2014  a thistle blooms where no one grieves,  and sings of men who spoke as one.",

They drank too deep, they loved too loud,  they stumbled through the midnight rain,  yet knelt to write a tender vow  in ink and blood and driving sleet.  No velvet minds, no soft-reply\u2014  their hands were calloused, hearts untrimmed,  they cursed the stars, defied the sky,  yet wept for beauty they could not name.  One sang of mice in ruined fields,  another laughed through prison bars;  they knew how hunger shapes the soul,  how loneliness can break the strong.  But in their flaws, a fire burned\u2014  a truth too real for gilded frames,  a song that rose from broken names  and carved its mark on Scotland\u2019s bones.  So when he spoke of those rough men,  the air grew thick with smoke and psalm,  with rebel hymns and women\u2019s charms,  with fists unclenched, with *Auld Lang Syne*.  For though the world may crown the sleek,  the smooth, the ones who play the game,  eternity remembers those  who lived too hard, yet died with flame\u2014  who, rude and rough, and full of scars,  still taught the weak to lift their eyes,  and in their broken, brawling cries,  left earth a kind of holy prayer.",

They swore at gods, they kissed the ground,  and in the pub, new worlds were found.

They knew the weight of silent grief\u2014  a child\u2019s lost breath, a failing chief\u2014  yet raised a glass, absurd, defiant,  and laughed as if the sky might listen.  Burns gave their rage a tuneful tongue,  their lust, their pride, their deep unrest,  and proved that truth is rarely sung  by those who pass the pure life\u2019s test.  It blooms in cracks, in smoke-filled rooms,  in cracked voices dispelling gloom.  So when he spoke, the air grew thick  with ghosts who\u2019d known both want and fire,  who taught that dignity can stick  to sinners fueled by love and ire.

Inside, a woman hums a lullaby to her coat,  a boy presses his palm to glass, chasing ghosts of fences,  and somewhere, a letter trembles in a pocket,  ink still wet with unspoken names.  This arrow knows no pause, no turning back\u2014  it carries futures folded in luggage,  regrets tucked beneath seats,  and love, perhaps, waiting at the next station,  wearing a red scarf, checking the time.

For love is not the absence of the fall\u2014  but choosing, breath by breath, to give your all,  not because it\u2019s safe, but because it\u2019s real:  a wound, a wonder, a wound that heals.",

Yet in the hush before the world takes form,  you sketch a name without a storm,  imagine touch without retreat,  a pulse that matches, warm and sweet.  Is it so dangerous to let the gate  unlatch, just once, to sealed fate?  Not every hand will rearrange your soul,  not every fire will take its toll.  Perhaps the bravest thing you\u2019ve left undone  is letting someone see you\u2014fully, one  by one, the cracks where light gets in.  For love\u2019s not conquest, nor a war to win,  but two shy flames that learn to breathe,  and in the trembling, dare to be.  So linger not in what may break.  The heart that fears to love, still aches.  And you\u2014so guarded, yet so deep\u2014  were meant to love, and thus to leap.",

Yet in the quiet, when shadows creep,  you trace the shape of hands that sleep  not in your own, but in your dreams\u2014  soft-voiced, unbroken, stitching seams  of hope across your hollowed seams.  You long to trust, to yield, to fall,  to answer love\u2019s unguarded call.  But what if kindness isn\u2019t guise?  What if someone sees your eyes\u2014  not as shields, but as the sea  that holds both storm and sanctuary?  Perhaps the bravest act you\u2019ll make  is not in flight, but in the ache  of staying. Of unfolding slow  the name you\u2019ve hidden even from snow.  For purity need not mean apart\u2014  sometimes, it beats at the center of heart.

Light breaks where no sun shines:  in the yes that follows no,  in the seed that splits in the dark  just to find the way down.  It is not salvation.

She watered it with rain caught in a bucket,  and sang it songs from the radio\u2014  ballads of heartbreak, trucks, and redemption.  Neighbors said it wouldn\u2019t last.  Too much concrete. Not enough sun.  But it rose\u2014stem crooked, proud\u2014  defying almanacs and zoning laws.  It bloomed during a drought,  when lawns turned to dust and hope was rationed.  And for one summer, that rose  was on every postcard,  in every high school yearbook margin,  pinned to lapels at the VFW.  Not because it was flawless\u2014  it had aphids, a bent petal, uneven growth\u2014  but because it survived  with nothing but neglect and a girl\u2019s whispered faith.  The perfect American Beauty Rose?  It wasn\u2019t perfect.  It was American.  And it was still growing.",

It fades slowly, stem bent from leaning toward fluorescent lights, its red a dye that bleeds into water like rusted loyalty. I saw one on a grave in Amarillo, left upright in a vase bolted to concrete, snow dusting its waxy face. Another bloomed in a prom corsage, fastened to a polyester lapel, trembling through slow dances and whispered lies. Once, I found a petal in an old atlas, folded at the Mississippi\u2014still red, still stubborn. Not wild. Not free. But persistent. This rose doesn\u2019t climb trellises; it climbs tax brackets, TV screens, the hush of suburban dinners where no one speaks but everyone smiles. It\u2019s planted in soil laced with gravel and dream fragments, nourished by sprinklers that hiss on timers.

Not on a pedigree vine, not under glass,  but where the earth is tired and the sky forgets to water.  Its stem was crooked, its leaves speckled with road salt and diesel,  yet it opened each morning like a hymn no one knew they needed.  It wasn\u2019t bred for bouquets or bride\u2019s hands,  but for the waitress who tucked it behind her ear  after her third double shift,  for the old man who touched its petals  like he was remembering a name he\u2019d lost.

It bled red\u2014yes\u2014but the kind of red  that stains a bandage, not a valentine.  They said perfection meant symmetry,  unblemished velvet, a spine without thorns.  But this rose wore its scars like medals.  It grew not in spite of the cracks,  but because of them.  The perfect American Beauty Rose?  It never came from a catalog.  It was never wrapped in cellophane or priced in dollars.  It was the one that dared to be soft  in a world that only rewards hardness\u2014  still breathing, still blushing,  still rising,  petal by stubborn petal,  through the weight of everything that said:  *Don\u2019t.*",

Its petals were the red of stop signs ignored, of lipstick on coffee cups at 5 a.m., of love letters never mailed. Not flawless\u2014no, one petal curled like a fist, another stained by soot from a grill that hadn\u2019t worked in years. But it bloomed anyway. In a suburb where lawns were law and dandelions were crimes, this rose broke rules just by existing. It didn\u2019t smell sweet\u2014it smelled of charcoal, of sweat after overtime, of rain on hot pavement. Girls wore it in their hair at prom, not because it matched their dresses, but because it looked like courage. Boys pressed it into yearbooks like proof: *I felt something. I was here.* It wasn\u2019t gifted on Valentine\u2019s Day. It was found, growing wild where no one tended, where no one expected beauty. And when the bulldozers came, paving dreams into cul-de-sacs, the roots stayed\u2014deep, quiet, resisting. The perfect American Beauty Rose wasn\u2019t flawless. It was fierce. It was ordinary. It was ours. And every time someone stopped, truly stopped, to look\u2014really look\u2014it proved that even in the manufactured, mowed, monitored heart of America, wildness could still rise, unasked, unafraid, red as reckoning.",

You chose silence, space,  the quiet of an untouched face  in moonlit rooms where shadows pass  like ghosts of almost, near, and was.  Yet what is safety but a cage  when even stars engage in blaze?  The sun does not withhold its light  for fear of casting false delight.  So when a hand extends, not fast,  not fierce, but steady as the grass  that bends but does not break in wind\u2014  might you, at last, let kindness in?  Not as surrender, not as end,  but as a bridge, a faithful friend?  For purity need not mean alone\u2014  it can be shared, like breath, like tone.  And commitment, gentle, slow, and true,  might be the home you never knew  you ached for: not a wound, but wing\u2014  the place where your whole heart can sing.  O guarded one, so wise, so worn\u2014  to love is not to be outworn.  It is to stand, both bare and bold,  and find you\u2019re not just safe, but known.",

The wind picks up each cast-off trace,  Whispers through holes where buttons used to be.  These hollows hum with echoes I embrace\u2014  Not lack, but space for what\u2019s yet meant to be.

O call that cracks the lining of my coat,  That rattles every hidden, hoarded stain\u2014  I stand unweighted, lighter than a note  That leaps the staff and never learns its name.  Shake out my pockets, let the fragments fly\u2014  I am the answer ringing back: *I\u2019m here.  Not in the things I kept, but in the cry,  The open hand, the voice that drew them near.*",

Yet in the hush where cities sleep, a different knowing starts to bloom\u2014 not carved in stone, nor sworn to keep, but rising from the scent of loam. A woman kneels to touch the ground, her fingers brushing sprouting green; no sermon calls, no drumbeat sound, but in that touch, the vast is seen. The wind recalls an older name, the moon leans low to bless her hands\u2014 not glory, but a quiet flame that burns in tending, not in asks. For truth has never dwelled alone in thrones above or scrolls of gold, but in the ache to mend a stone, in stories gently to be told. It walks with those who bear the night, who feed the stray, who sit with grief, whose love refuses blinding light, and finds the sky in small relief. So let the stars recede in veils, let temples fade to dust and root\u2014 when one heart dares to feel, not rails, the heavens breathe, and truth takes root.",

Upon this couch, the universe  Contracts into a single breath.  And in the hush, I come to terms:  This is, and always has been, rest.",

No sword of fire, no thundered *no*,  just silence where the garden grew  too small for all they now could hold:  a mind that dreamed, a heart that broke.  They turned not from a watchful eye,  but toward the moon, the open sky,  where shadows stretched with strange new grace,  and stars mapped exile\u2019s first embrace.  Eve lifted her face to wind, not weep.  Adam carved a name in stone to keep.  No angels barred the path behind\u2014  just love, now tangled, thorned, and blind.  Yet in the ache, a pulse remained:  not grace undone, but rearranged.

Overcame? Yes\u2014not by escape,  but by the risk of shape, of name,  by choosing thirst, by tasting fear,  by holding fast what wasn\u2019t clear.

One for the dream, one for the hope they crushed.  She named the crows on power lines her squad,  the wind the rival, time the referee.

They do not warm, but they abide\u2014  like hope that doesn\u2019t shout, but stays.  And in their chill, we recognize  the quiet grace of steadfast days.  Sharp is the night, but stars with frost alive  are not the end\u2014the cut, the gleam\u2014  but proof that even ice can give  a kind of light, a frozen dream  that guards the world until it breathes,  until the thaw, the green, the flame.  The night may bite, but underneath,  the living whisper the same:  We are here. We still remain.",
