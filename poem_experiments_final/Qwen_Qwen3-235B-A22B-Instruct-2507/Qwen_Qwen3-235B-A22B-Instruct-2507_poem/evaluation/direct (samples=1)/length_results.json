We trade our sons for hollow medals,  our daughters for the myth of peace,  while generals sip their tea in marble rooms,  counting victories that never cease.  A joke? Perhaps. But who is laughing?  The widow stitching names in thread?  The child who counts the sirens nightly,  or the ghost who haunts the soldier\u2019s bed?  We joke in metaphors and slogans,  in flags that wave above the slain,  in speeches polished, pain repackaged  to justify the endless gain.  War\u2019s a game of kings and borders  drawn by hands that never fight.  We are pawns who march and stumble,  blinking in the flash of light.  And when the dust has choked the dawns,  when every anthem fades to rust,  we\u2019ll whisper jokes to numb the knowing\u2014  we were the punchline.  We were the cost.",

War\u2019s a joke\u2014the rationed bread gone stale,  the letter burned before it reached the hand,  the child who mimics gunfire in his play,  the mother humming lullabies to sand.  We laugh because the weeping takes too long,  because the silence eats what words once planned.  War\u2019s a joke when borders shift like sand,  redrawn by men who\u2019ve never slept in fear.  They toast in halls with wine and steady hands,  while we salute the ghosts who gather near.  Our jests are edged with sorrow, thinly veiled\u2014  a dance of shadows only trauma shares.  War\u2019s a joke when peace is just a pause,  a breath between the thunder and the flame.  They teach it in old books as noble cause,  but here, it\u2019s just a whisper, never name.  And when the final gun at last goes mute,  we\u2019ll laugh\u2014then vanish, all of us, the same.  War\u2019s a joke for me and you, they claim\u2026  but gods, how the punchline never feels quite true.",

For every line they call \"delusional,\"  he paints a sky I once believed\u2014  now labeled false, irrational,  a madness too profoundly perceived.  So when he looks with that clear, strange dread,  I wonder\u2014am I the one misled?  His eyes, unblinking, wide, and wise,  reflect the world behind the lies.  And I\u2014I look away. I lie.",

Not to linger, not to weep, but to hold the quiet grace  of dandelions gone to seed, of an unguarded face.  I\u2019d watch my father at the door, his coat still damp with night,  his silhouette against the hall, so solid, so in flight.  And I\u2019d save the way my mother smiled when she thought no one saw\u2014  a flicker soft as candlelight behind the kitchen door.  Rewind not to alter fate, nor call the vanished near,  but to carry forward every breath I almost didn\u2019t hear.  For in memory\u2019s quiet rewind, I find what I can\u2019t keep:  the love that shaped me, wave on wave, while I was learning to sleep.  And now I wake, not to the past, but to its gentle ember\u2014  alive, because I learned to rewind life and remember.",

Tonight: partly cloudy with a chance of memories.  A mother hums a lullaby beneath a blanket of stars  that do not flinch when the city blinks out.  The moon, a sliver of chalk on blackboard sky,  scribbles equations no child is allowed to solve.  Tomorrow: unpredictable. Always unpredictable.  A forecast written in smoke and footprints,  erased by dawn\u2019s reluctant light.  They say the seasons are changing\u2014  but the calendar lies.  Winter has overstayed in the bones of the city.

Not for the war, but what lies in  The quiet vow you cannot keep:  To walk again through garden gates,  To hold that child, to shed no weight.  So rise. The day is peeping.

Their faces chiselled by the gale,  Their voices raw, yet strangely frail  When, in the hush of twilight\u2019s hush,  They\u2019d whisper verses, soft as blush.  No velvet words in their command,  No gilded tales from foreign land\u2014  Just barley fields and auld acquaintance,  And love that broke with cruel mischance.  They drank too deep, they laughed too loud,  They bore the lash beneath the cloud  Of judgment cast by polished men  Who\u2019d never bled for soil or kin.  Yet in their eyes, a steady flame\u2014  Not pride, but something closer to grace:  A knowledge that the dirt and grime  Could birth a lyric, pure as rhyme.  So he spoke of Burns, and I saw rise  The ghosts of men with storm-lit eyes,  Who, though the world called them coarse and rough,  Held galaxies in a working glove.  And I, so neat in thought and speech,  Felt poverty beyond belief\u2014  For all my words, so clean, so tame,  Had never kindled such a flame.",

It will not turn to dust  until the final station where all journeys are undone.  And when it slows, at last, to silence thick and deep,  its echo lingers\u2014whispering through roots and riverbeds:  *Even in darkness, something dares to leap.*",

They\u2019re messengers sent from a sky overwrought,  meant not to linger, but to map where I\u2019ve been,  rivers that rise only to sink back within.  So I cry, though the salt fades without a trace,  and carve my heart\u2019s hymn on time\u2019s blank face.  Alone, yes\u2014but not unaccompanied:  the ghost of each tear still walks unladen.",

And I learned:  to be born in famine  is not to be born without song.  It is to carry a flame  in the pocket of your ribs,  to walk\u2014  not toward rescue,  but toward rebirth.  Now when I speak,  the soil listens.  And somewhere beneath the sand,  a seed remembers its name.",

You\u2019ve held love like a fragile bird  cupped too long in trembling hands,  until its wings grew heavy  with the weight of hesitation.

But listen: even the most cautious bloom  must one day face the sun.  Even the shyest stream,  afraid of oceans, finds its way.  So let your guarded gates unclench.  Let your silence learn to sing.  For to be stained is to be known,  and to be known\u2014is to be home.  O heart, so wary, so afraid\u2014  perhaps the purest act of love  is not to stay untouched,  but to leap, and fall, and rise again.",

No throne could claim me, nor crown fit  As well as this worn, loving pit.  The lamp glows gold; the night draws in\u2014  The universe begins within.

She nodded, but the silence grew  a garden in her head\u2014  where phantom crowds still chant and leap,  where captains rise on sparks of flame,  where every loss is just a breath  before the winning score\u2019s reclaimed.  She smiled, as if to say, *It\u2019s fine,*  but I saw the way her knuckles shone\u2014  white stars of faith against the dark,  still clinging to a frequency  no radio could carry now.  The truth sat heavy, soft, and plain:  no field, no clock, no final whistle\u2014  just love that plays despite the game.  And maybe that\u2019s the only match  that matters when the lights go dim:  not who stood tallest on the pitch,  but who believes in them.",

I glory in the dawn I fought to earn,  In bridges built where no path dared to turn.  For birth may crown the head, but skill the soul\u2014  And mine has climbed to claim its hard-won role.

It tugged me past the silted dreams that settled on its bed,  past willows weeping backward, past the words I left unsaid.  The rain came in November, and the frost in April stayed,  but still the water wound its truth through every shade it made.  I waded where the stones were sharp, where shadows held their breath,  where grief, a quiet heron, stood beside the edge of death.  I stumbled on the gravel, knelt to drink the bitter flow,  and learned that even poison can become a kind of glow.  For miles, I did not know your name. I did not know your face.  I only felt the current pull with unrelenting grace.  And when at last the channel thinned and opened to your shore,  I saw your hands were shaping light, and I could hurt no more.  The river didn\u2019t promise ease, nor claim the path was right\u2014  it only said, *Keep moving. Love outlasts the night.*  So here I stand, worn smooth and true, where all my search began:  the river led me to you. The river was the plan.",

The river? Only a silver thread now.
