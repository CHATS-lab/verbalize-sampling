A subterranean, crimson glow, where bitter roots of sorrow grow. It feeds on slights, on words unsaid, on promises that lie now dead. Each memory a spark, a coal, igniting anguish in my soul. No outward flame, no violent burst, just a constant, unquenchable thirst for justice, or for what might be, a twisted, dark reality. It hardens bones, and chills the blood, a slow, relentless, rising flood. Oh, to extinguish this inner strife, to find a solace, and a new life. But it clings to me, a parasitic vine, an ever-present, dark design. A constant companion, a heavy shroud, lost in its silent, fiery cloud.",

No outward sign, no tear, no shout, just a hollow feeling, a creeping doubt. It builds a cage around my heart, tearing my very soul apart. Each breath a gasp, each moment strained, by this dark fury, self-sustained. Oh, to release this heavy load, to walk a less tormented road.

It twists the light to shadow, distorts the truth to lie, and paints the world in hues of red beneath a smoke-filled sky. It whispers tales of vengeance, of wrongs that must be righted, a simmering cauldron of resentment, eternally ignited. Though I try to douse its fury, with reason's gentle rain, it only seems to smolder, then erupts in fiery pain. This internal inferno, a burden I must bear, a silent, raging torment, a constant, heavy care. It stains my thoughts, my actions, a bitter, acrid taste, and leaves behind a barren landscape, a desolate, emotional waste. When will its embers finally fade, and peace reclaim its hold?

The grass was greener then, the sky a deeper blue, adventures lay around each bend, fresh, exciting, new. No burdens weighed the spirit, no shadows held their sway, just laughter light as dandelion fluff, that danced throughout the day. Now looking back, the distance stretches, vast and undefined, a cosmic journey traversed, leaving so much behind. The faces blur, the voices fade, like signals from afar, extinguished stars of yesterday, no longer where they are. A silent, ancient chronicle, etched in time's dark scroll, the innocence of yesteryear, beyond my current soul. And though I walk familiar paths, and breathe the same old air, that radiant, distant childhood, is simply no longer there.",

The warmth of your embrace, now just a fading light, a supernova's echo, lost in the endless night. The laughter that once filled the air, a whisper in the void, a distant, faint emission, forever unemployed. And though I scan the heavens, for signs of what we were, only empty space reflects, the silence of a blur.

A folded letter, on the sill, a promise kept, or standing still? The fabric cool against her skin, a world without, a world within.

The world outside can rush and roar, but here, she finds an open door, to dreams untold, and thoughts profound, where solace in the stillness can be found.
