The bugle's last plea,Fades on the wind, setting your spirit free.No more the harsh drumbeat, the mud and the strife,Only the stillness, the end of your life.Your helmet lies empty, your rifle laid down,A hero departing, from village and town.We stand here in silence, our voices held low,Watching your journey, as cold winds now blow.The flag, draped so gently, a somber embrace,Covers the courage we saw in your face.A lifetime of moments, now frozen in time,A sacrifice given, a purpose sublime.The sun dips below, painting crimson the west,A final salute as you go to your rest.Though tears freely fall, and our hearts ache with pain,Your memory, soldier, will ever remain.For freedom you fought, with a spirit so true,A legacy etched, for the ages anew.Sleep soundly, brave warrior, your battle is done,Your place in our history, forever hard-won.ADIEU, O soldier! Your spirit takes flight,Into the heavens, and into the light.", "turn": 5}]}
