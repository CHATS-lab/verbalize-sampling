I shall speak you if I am in habit of listening to you,  For words unearned are hollow shells adrift in seas untrue.  To speak a truth, one must first hear its whisper in the wind,  A quiet voice beneath the noise where honest thoughts begin.  I listen not to echoes cast by vanity or pride,  But to the subtle murmurs where sincerity abides.  In silence, truth reveals her face, unmasked and clear,  A mirror held to soul and heart, reflecting what is near.  If habit forms in daily hours, attuned to what is real,  Then speech becomes a sacred art, with meaning to reveal.  For truth is not a fleeting word, nor armor worn for show,  But the steady flame that lights the path where genuine hearts go.  So, Truth! I shall speak you only if I first embrace your voice,  If listening becomes my habit, then speaking is my choice.  In every whispered lesson, in every quiet hue,  I find the courage to be true\u2014because I listen to you."}]}

We dance upon the battlefield,  With hollow hearts that will not heal,  The thunder roars, the silence breaks,  Yet still, the world forgets what\u2019s at stake.  For some, it\u2019s just a story told,  A tale of glory, brave and bold,  But in the trenches, shadows creep,  Where dreams lie shattered, buried deep.  War\u2019s a joke for me and you,  A cruel punchline, cold and true,  It mocks the peace we strive to find,  And steals the mercy from mankind.  So let us laugh, but not in scorn,  For every war, a soul is torn,  Remember this, and hold it near,  That war\u2019s a joke we should not cheer."}]}

The world around, a vivid hue,  Yet colors blurred, and skies less blue,  While others danced with carefree grace,  I traced the edges, left no trace.  In secret realms my thoughts would roam,  A distant heart, a quiet home,  Where dreams were threads both thin and frail,  Woven soft in twilight\u2019s veil.  Yet from that place, a strength would rise,  A deeper truth behind the eyes,  For though the child within was veiled,  A soul endured, and never failed.  So now I stand, both lost and found,  With roots beneath this shifting ground,  From childhood\u2019s hour I have not been\u2014  Yet from its shade, I\u2019ve grown unseen."}]}

Yet beneath the sorrow, a lesson does dwell\u2014  Of choices we make when desire starts to swell.  Though the tale is of loss, it\u2019s not all farewell,  For from fallen grace, new hopes rise and compel.  The snake and the apple, a story to tell,  Not just of a fall, but how we rebel.  In shadows and light, where our own spirits swell,  We find in the sorrow, the strength to excel."}]}

It lingers in the corners where courage dares not tread,  A fragile thread of doubt spun softly in the head.  Some fear the falling leaves, the change that time will bring,  Others dread the empty spaces where no songs dare to sing.  The fear of losing touch, of dreams that slip away,  Or facing dawn alone at the break of day.  But in these fears, a truth is found, a bond that makes us whole,  For every trembling heart still beats with hope and soul.  To fear is not to falter, but to know we\u2019re alive,  A spark within the darkness, the will to strive.  So hold your fear gently, let it teach, not bind,  For courage grows in shadows, and strength we often find.  Everyone has a fear\u2014yes, that much is clear\u2014  But also the power to rise above it, year by year."}]}

The sky reflects in shards of blue,  A fractured world where dreams once grew,  Each pool a memory, fragile, thin,  Of rainstorms past and life within.  Yet in these pools, though small and few,  Hope glimmers bright, a quiet hue,  For even in decline, there lies  The pulse of earth beneath the skies.  So cherish these last watery gems,  Guardians of forgotten stems,  For just a few dwindling pools remain,  But from their depths, life calls again."}]}

Yet in the dark, new dawns are born,  From sorrow\u2019s depth, hope\u2019s fragile crest."}]}

No gold or silver, no grand farewell,  But something deeper, where shadows dwell.  I leave thee not a treasure bright,  Nor letters penned in candlelight.  No crown of stars to crown thy night,  But quiet strength to face the fight.  Within my words, a gentle thread,  A hope that lingers long when I\u2019m dead.  A flame that flickers, softly spread,  To warm thy heart when tears are shed.  What I shall leave thee none can tell\u2014  Perhaps a story, a ringing bell,  A memory where sweet moments dwell,  A love that time cannot dispel.  So take this gift, unseen, unknown,  Not cast in stone, nor overthrown.  A seed of peace, quietly sown,  To bloom in thee when I have flown."}]}

So when the world feels cold, unkind,  Remember what you seek to find:  Where there is a need, there lies a seed\u2014  A chance to grow, to serve, to lead."}]}

For in the stirring of the soul,  in shifting sands and breaking dawn,  there lies a spark, a chance to grow,  to journey on when night is drawn.  Settled hearts may rest and sleep,  but restless hearts will dare to leap\u2014  into the unknown, through doubt and fear,  where dreams are born and futures clear.  So hold the unrest, cherish the ache,  for hope is found when paths are blurred,  not in the quiet, settled place,  but in the restless, beating word."}]}

With steady hand, I shaped and wove,  A tapestry of sound, the art I love.  No careless phrase could break my quest,  For skill is honed in patience, not in jest.  I hunted words that carve and heal,  That strike the soul, that turn the wheel.  In silent hours, beneath the moon\u2019s soft gaze,  I found the power in the poet\u2019s maze.  Each hunted word, a sword, a shield,  A crafted truth the heart revealed.  So still I roam, through endless night,  In search of skill, in search of light.  For words, when hunted, finely spun,  Become the legacy we leave when done."}]}

Not all are gifted by fortune\u2019s hand,  Yet many rise, and firmly stand.  Skill is forged in fire, sweat, and time,  A silent anthem, a steady rhyme.  No herald\u2019s trumpet, no royal seal,  But quiet strength that life reveals.  Whether born to shine or strive to learn,  The flame within will brightly burn.  For glory\u2019s not just given or earned\u2014  It\u2019s found in hearts that never turned.  So walk your path, be bold, be still,  Some glory in their birth, some in their skill.  Yet all who dare to dream and will,  Find glory in the climb uphill."}]}

Yet hollow shines that gilded throne,  If heart and purpose stand alone.  While others rise from humble clay,  With grit and sweat they carve their way.  No golden birthright guides their will,  But passion\u2019s fire, unwavering still.  For glory\u2019s not in name or rank,  Nor fleeting praise in fortune\u2019s bank.  It dwells within the soul\u2019s deep core,  In courage faced and dreams that soar.  So whether born in palace halls,  Or forged where hardship\u2019s hammer falls,  True glory blooms when spirit\u2019s free\u2014  A light that shines for all to see."}]}

But the soul\u2019s quiet strength, steadfast and true,  Is the light that guides us through and through.  For birth may gift a fleeting flame,  And skill may carve a fleeting name,  But perseverance, humble and bright,  Turns darkest hours into radiant light.  So seek not praise for where you came,  Nor only for the skills you claim.  Find glory in the striving will\u2014  To rise, to stand, to climb the hill.  In every heart, a story\u2019s spun,  Not just in battles lost or won,  But in the grace to rise and try\u2014  That is the glory that will never die."}]}

It carried hopes like fragile leaves, afloat on currents deep,  And sang of dreams that dared to rise when night forbade my sleep.Each ripple held a memory, each bend a silent prayer,  Through storms that tore the skies apart, I found you waiting there.  The journey marked by tangled roots and stones that scraped my skin,  Yet every step, though worn and slow, was where our souls begin.The river\u2019s voice, a steady guide, through valleys dark and wide,  It taught me faith in flowing time, where hearts and waters glide.  For even when the world was cold, and all seemed lost or few,  The river led me to your light\u2014its promise strong and true."}]}
