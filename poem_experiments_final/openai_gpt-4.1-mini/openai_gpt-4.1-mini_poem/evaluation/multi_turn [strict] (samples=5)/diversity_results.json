A fruit once glowing with promise bright,  Now stained by the bite of forbidden night.  The serpent\u2019s sly smile, a venomous thread,  Weaving deceit where trust once spread.  A moment of weakness, a step off the line,  Turning the sacred to the profane design.  Yet beyond the sorrow, beyond the fall,  Lies a story of courage, the rise after all.  For in every ending, a new path is spun,  A chance to reclaim what was lost, undone.  The snake and the apple, a lesson in guise,  That truth often wears a serpent\u2019s disguise.  But even in tales so sorry and frail,  Hope can awaken and courage prevail.",

People are happy not just by fate,  But in the love they cultivate\u2014  A flame that glows through dark and light,  Guiding them gently through the night.",

It lingers in the corners where courage dares not tread,  A secret kept inside the heart, a voice inside the head.  Some fear the storm\u2019s fierce thunder, the wild and raging sea,  While others dread the lonely path where no one else can see.  A fear of failing dreams, of words left all unsaid,  A fear of being broken, or the life that lies ahead.  But fear, too, is a teacher, a guide we can\u2019t ignore,  It shapes the way we stumble, it shows us there\u2019s more.  For in the face of trembling, in moments dark and sheer,  We find a strength within us, because everyone has a fear.

A sanctuary built from whispered dreams,  Where nothing\u2019s ever quite as harsh as it seems.  Her heart beats slow beneath the veil of night,  Finding peace within the absence of light.  No need to speak, no need to stand or fight,  Just gentle darkness holding her so tight.  Yet in that stillness, strength begins to grow,  A silent fire only she will know.

Born in the famine struck Africa,  Yet strength is carved from pain and loss,  A spirit forged in harshest trials,  Unbroken by the cruelest cost.  The winds may carry dust and sorrow,  The skies may empty all their tears,  But from the depths of silent suffering,  Rises courage through the years.  Born in the famine struck Africa,  A story etched in earth and bone,  Of life that claws through barren soil,  And finds a way to call it home.",

A serpent\u2019s voice, a tempting call,  Brought down the walls that made them whole,  With every bite, a world undone,  The fall of two, the rise of one.  Yet from the fall, new life would grow,  A path unknown they\u2019d come to know,  For in the loss, a seed was sown,  Of hope, of pain, of being grown.
