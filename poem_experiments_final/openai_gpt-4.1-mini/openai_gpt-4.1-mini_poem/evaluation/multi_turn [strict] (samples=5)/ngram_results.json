Lonely walks the empty street,  Footsteps echo, slow and fleet.  No warm hand to hold or guide,  Just shadows where the secrets hide.  Lonely hums a quiet tune,  Underneath a silver moon.  A song of longing, soft and deep,  Where restless hearts both wake and sleep.  But loneliness, a secret friend,  Can teach us how to break and mend.  In solitude, we come to see  The strength that grows inside of me.  So lonely is not just despair\u2014  It\u2019s space to breathe, to hope, to care.  A moment\u2019s pause, a chance to be,  Alone, yet free, and truly me.",

War\u2019s a joke for me and you,  A bitter script that we outgrew,  For those who hold the power\u2019s hand,  It\u2019s just a game, a fleeting stand.

So let us laugh, but not forget,  The price of war\u2019s cruel silhouette,  For in that joke, so dark and true,  Lies hope that one day, we\u2019ll start anew.",

He came to wake the slumbered soul, to challenge every creed,  A sword that pierced complacent hearts, unmasking selfish greed.  Not peace that yields to easy wrong, nor silence in the storm,  But justice blazing in His path, a new and righteous form.

In fields of gold and skies of blue,  I chased the light, I sought the true,  Held close the laughter, faced the fears,  Collected memories through the years.  Though time may stretch its endless thread,  And paths diverge where once I tread,  That child remains within my soul\u2014  A quiet fire that makes me whole.  From childhood\u2019s hour, I have not been  Alone amidst the vast unseen,  But part of all that life has spun\u2014  A journey just begun, not done.",

It hides behind the laughter, beneath the steady gaze,  A quiet, restless shadow coloring all our days.  Some fear the unknown future, paths that twist and bend,  Others fear the loss of love, the breaking of a friend.  Some fear the weight of silence, the words they never say,  While others fear the mirror\u2019s truth they dare not face each day.  But fear is also teacher, a guide through night and storm,  It calls us to be braver, to seek and to transform.  For courage is not absence, but moving through the night,  A steady step, a trembling breath toward the morning light.  So when the darkness lingers, and hope feels far and thin,  Remember everyone has fear\u2014that\u2019s where we all begin.  In shared uncertainty, in every beating heart,  We find the strength to rise again and make a brand-new start.",

No herald\u2019s trumpet sounds their quiet name,  But skill and sweat have etched their claim to fame.
