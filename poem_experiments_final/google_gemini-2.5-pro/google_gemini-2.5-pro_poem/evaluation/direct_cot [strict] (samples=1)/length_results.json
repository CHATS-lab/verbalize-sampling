It lives in my marrow, a low, constant hum beneath the surface of my skin. It is the furnace that glows behind my eyes when pleasantries are exchanged, the magma core beneath the thin crust of my smile. It asks for no audience, throws no tantrums, and breaks no glass. Instead, it melts my memories, reforging old hurts into something sharp, something hard I can hold onto.\n\nThis heat is a secret sun I carry in my gut. It warms me through the coldest nights of indifference and fuels a will that others mistake for simple quiet. But it also warps the light, casting long shadows from small things and turning calm waters into a mirage. Every word is weighed, every breath a careful measure to keep the embers from flaring into a tell-tale flame. They see composure, a placid surface, never knowing the immense, silent pressure contained just beneath, the constant, searing work of keeping the world from seeing the fire that both defines and devours me.",

Each blade was a sliver of mercury, catching the cool light and tossing it to its neighbor in a silent, shimmering relay. The field became an ocean, and I stood at its shore, listening. The sound was not of water, but of a thousand tiny whispers, the earth's secrets shared on the night air. It spoke of the sun's warmth stored deep in the soil, of the quick, fleeting lives of field mice, and the slow, geologic patience of the stones beneath. The wind was a gentle hand, stroking the land's ancient brow, smoothing away the harsh lines of the day. It smelled of cool dust and distant rain. I felt my own sharp edges soften, my thoughts slowing to match the rhythmic sway. In the dance of that silver grass, the world felt whole, ancient, and profoundly peaceful, and my own small worries were simply carried away on the current, lost in the luminous tide.",
