It does not flame, it has no sane control, it only glows, a single, watchful eye, while upstairs, life pretends to hurry by. The floorboards of my ribs will sometimes creak, a phantom chill ascends to touch my cheek. It is a presence in the quiet halls, it writes its shadowed name upon the walls. This house of bone and blood was once my own, but now a hostile tenant reigns alone. I lock the door, pretend it isn't there, and breathe the sulfur on the basement air. But late at night, I hear it shift and sigh, a promise that the structure soon will die, consumed not by a fire, loud and fast, but by the smoldering hatred of the past.",

Her suitcase held three worn-out sweaters and a map of a city she\u2019d only seen in films, its streets drawn like lifelines. The whistle blew, a sharp cry against the sleepy silence of her hometown, a town of closed doors and watchful eyes. She pressed her face to the cool glass, not looking back at the familiar fields, but forward, into the grey, misty unknown. The excitement wasn't joy, not yet. It was a nervous, thrumming thing, a hummingbird\u2019s heart trapped in her ribs. It was the terror and the thrill of a single, irreversible choice. The 'linger' was the last thread of doubt, the final whisper of 'what if?' snapping under the train's momentum. As the sun broke, it didn\u2019t illuminate the past, but the dust motes dancing in the carriage, each one a tiny, possible world.

And I saw them, through the window pane,\nThe ghosts of Burns's men, standing in the rain.\n\nNot ploughmen, but the ghosts of steel, with faces grim,\nHaunting the gates of factories, shuttered on a whim.\nTheir pride, a currency now worthless. And the talk\nOf 'social commentary' on a pleasant campus walk\nSeemed hollow, like a language from a foreign shore.\nThe men rude and rough are with us, poorer than before,\nWhile academics catalogue their ancient ache,\nA footnote to a world they can no longer make.",

The words form a picture in my head, curated from newsreels and charity appeals: a child\u2019s wide eyes, the geography of a clavicle, the baked-mud floor. It\u2019s a story I can consume, a tragedy I can hold at arm\u2019s length. I feel a pang, a sterile ache of empathy that costs me nothing. I can click a link, donate, and feel the brief, clean satisfaction of a good deed. But what do I know of the sun as an enemy? Of a mother\u2019s empty hands? Your reality is a headline, a poem I try to write with well-fed fingers. You were born in the famine, and I was born with the privilege of merely hearing about it, a chasm between us that no words can truly bridge.",

It is in the lines drawn on maps by foreign hands, lines that severed ancient grazing routes and sowed the seeds of discord. My grandfather told stories of the earth\u2019s generosity, before the great thefts of spirit and soil. My grandmother taught us the names of every edible root, a knowledge passed down like a sacred text. We were born into this chapter of a long, cruel story. The famine was a symptom, the fever of a land still wounded by history. So when you see the dust, see also the ghosts of looted kingdoms. When you see the hunger, see also the resilience forged in the fire of centuries. We are not just children of this famine; we are the descendants of survivors, and that legacy is a different kind of nourishment.",

I did not stay to see the rains, or feel the first shoots push through clay. I am a ghost on the harmattan wind, in the heat that shimmers all the day. I am the silence in the cooking pot, the space beside my mother as she sleeps. I watch her trace the empty air, a map of sorrows that she keeps. I have no hunger, feel no thirst, I ride the currents, thin and free. But I see the living, and their burden is a heavier weight than what burdened me. I watch my brother, gaunt and tall, share his small portion with a friend. I see the strength that grows in absence, a love that hunger cannot end. I am the memory they carry, a shadow in the midday sun, a silent witness to their struggle, until their long, hard journey\u2019s done. I was a child of the great famine, a story told in fading light.",

It blooms behind a white picket fence, its roots tangled in the quiet desperation of a two-car garage. This rose is not a gift of love, but a centerpiece for obsession, imagined on a bed of naked skin, petals falling in a slow-motion dream. It is the one perfect thing in a house of plastic smiles and silent dinners. Its fragrance doesn\u2019t sweeten the air; it masks the scent of bleached countertops and simmering resentment. Each thorn is a secret kept, a sharp word swallowed. The gardeners wear pristine gloves, but the soil is dark with what\u2019s been buried. When its petals finally drop, they don\u2019t decay. They look like stains on the sterile white tile, a beautiful wound that was always meant to open, the final, stunning collapse of a flawless facade.",

I whisper and turn,\nA lesson in leaving I never could learn.\nMy war is now over, my peace has begun,\nA shadow that lengthens toward the setting sun.",
