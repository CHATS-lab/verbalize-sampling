The gentle breeze, a knife.A minor siege, a pause within my life.The scent of toast, a torture. Coffee, sour.Yet in this muffled, weary, fevered hour,A certain solace settles, soft and deep.No outward striving, just the need for sleep.The phone lies silent, emails left unread,A quiet freedom rests within my head.For once, the frantic pulse of life retreats,And I am wrapped in blankets, soft and neat.The world can rush, can clamor, can demand,But I am moored upon this tired land.Beneath the weight of tissues, used and new,A strange, peculiar peace can filter through.Until the cough subsides, the nose is clear,And life's loud symphony once more I hear."}]}

This minute.A square of light, a silken thread,Unspooling dreams inside my head.The world outside, a vibrant hum,Before the quiet shadows come.This minute. The glass reflects my face,A transient whisper, time and space.The clouds drift by, a painted scene,Of what has been, or yet will be.A robin lands, a crimson flash,Ignoring all my hurried dashThrough days of tasks and anxious fears,It simply sings, for all to hear.That's my window. A framed expanse,Where seasons gather, take a stance.The autumn leaves, a fiery art,The winter's hush, a frozen heart.But now, this minute, sunbeams bright,Pour golden liquid, pure delight.A fleeting glimpse, a sudden grace,Reflected in this empty space.This minute. The world breathes in, breathes out,Dispelling every single doubt.I watch it live, I feel it sway,And know that I am here today.No past regrets, no future strain,Just sun-kissed pane, and gentle rainThat might soon fall, or softest snow,But in this minute, I simply knowThat this is mine, this patch of sky,Before the moments hurry by."}]}
