I shall speak you if I am in habit of listening to you,For a tongue untethered, a mind unbent,Is a vessel for echoes, a spirit well-spent,Not in the clamor of self-righteous hue,But in the quiet hum of what's genuinely true.I've chased you through shadows, across sun-drenched plains,Heard you whisper in sorrow, in joy's gentle rains.You're not a loud shout, a decree from on high,But a subtle unfolding, beneath a clear sky.You're in the rustle of leaves, the sigh of the breeze,The wisdom of elders, the hum of the bees.To speak you, then, is to first understand,The intricate weave of your delicate strand.It's to silence the ego, the clamoring need,To plant in the garden a genuine seed.For how can I voice what I haven't yet heard?How can I share an unspoken word?So let my ears open, my spirit embrace,The myriad forms of your luminous grace.Let me listen intently, with heart open wide,To the currents of reason, where your waters reside.Then, and only then, with a purpose so clear,Will your voice through my own, resonate, crystal and sheer."}]}

And with a mighty roar,The pent-up torrent crashed upon the shore.No gentle trickle, but a deluge grand,Washing away the castles built on sand.The mind, a fortress, built of steel and stone,Where every doubt and worry had been sown.It finally snapped! The lock, the bolted door,Unleashing thoughts it couldn't hold no more.A kaleidoscope of memories, bright and dim,Swirling in chaos, reaching to the brim.The heart, a fragile vase, so often cracked,With love unreturned, and promises attacked.It finally snapped! The last, thin, binding string,Releasing pain, a bitter, stinging thing.But in that break, a space began to bloom,For healing light to banish all the gloom.It finally snapped! A breaking, yes, but then,A chance to mend, to build anew again.From shattered pieces, beauty can arise,A stronger form, beneath the open skies.For sometimes breaking is the only way,To find the dawn, and greet a brand new day."}]}
