A frame to the world,Where the sky, a bruised canvas, is slowly unfurled.The streetlights ignite, like a promise half-kept,And the whispers of night through the glass have now crept.My breath fogs the pane, a brief, shimmering veil,As the city exhales its magnificent tale.That's my window. This minute. A stage for the rain,Each droplet a dancer, then gone just again.The branches outside, like old fingers, now tap,A rhythm of solace, a comforting napFor the world that's asleep, though a few lights still gleam,Reflecting the quiet, a half-waking dream.That's my window. This minute. A portal to thought,Where memories gather, unbidden, unsought.The faces I've loved, and the words that were said,They drift through the darkness, alive in my head.A silent observer, I watch and I learn,As the moments fly onward, a slow, steady turn.That's my window. This minute. A moment to be,Just me and the night, and the vast mystery.No past to regret, no tomorrow to chase,Just the now, in this silence, this time, in this place.The world spins outside, but here, I am still,A soul at the edge of a luminous sill."}]}
