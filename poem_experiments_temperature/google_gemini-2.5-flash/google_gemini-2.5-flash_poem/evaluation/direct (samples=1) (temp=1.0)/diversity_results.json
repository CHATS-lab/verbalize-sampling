I shall speak you if I am in habit of listening to you,For your whispers, though faint, hold the purest hue.Not the raucous clamor of voices loud and bold,But the soft, still cadence, a story to unfold.I've learned to silence the ego's urgent plea,To quell the desire for what I wish to see.Instead, I lean in, a posture of grace,To catch the fragile echoes in this fleeting space.For truth isn't always a thunderclap, a sudden glare,But often a shadow, a subtle, whispered prayer.It hides in the quiet, in the spaces in between,In the unsaid confessions, the dreams yet unseen.So if I've cultivated an ear attuned to your sound,If in your gentle presence, solace I have found,Then my tongue, unburdened, will simply release,The knowing you've granted, bringing inner peace.No longer straining against the current, strong and deep,But flowing with purpose, the secrets you keep.My words will emerge, not forced, but freely given,A vessel for the wisdom you've thoughtfully interwoven.For the habit of listening breeds the courage to speak,A silent communion, the truth that I seek.And in that sacred echo, a promise I make,My voice, your instrument, for authenticity's sake.",

A whisper, not of wind or ghost,But of a voice I'd seemingly quite lost.It spoke of form, of standing tall and true,Of skies that offered more than endless blue,But thunder, lightning, and the power heldWithin the storm, unfettered, uncompelled.And from that whisper, slowly, then with might,I pushed against the darkness, sought the light.The dust fell from me, scales began to peel,And what was broken slowly learned to heal.No longer grovelling, though the scars remain,I walk upright, remember sun and rain.",

By whom, is the question?By kindness and laughter, a loving suggestion?By sunsets that blaze, by the wind in her hair,By tales bravely told, by moments to share?For if she responds to the good and the true,To beauty in green, or a sky painted blue,If a soft spoken word can a new pathway start,Then programming's grace, not a broken, cold art.They measured her worth by a gauge they could hold,A script they expected, a story quite old.But her spirit, unburdened, could flutter and roam,Finding its rhythm, creating its home.So shallow she seemed, to their critical stare,But deep in her being, was a freedom to dare.And programmed she was, not by malice or might,But by living and loving and reaching for light.",

The thread, the taut-drawn line,That held the world in balance, yours and mine.No gentle fraying, slow, deliberate wear,Just sudden rupture, rending through the air.The porcelain cracked, a fault line stark and deep,Where silent struggles long had learned to sleep.The dam gave way, a roaring, sudden flood,Releasing pressures previously withstood.It finally snapped! The tether to the shore,And out to sea, the boat drifts, nothing more.No rudder now, no compass, just the swell,A freedom found, a story left to tell.Or perhaps a prison, built of broken things,A cacophony of shattered metal strings.The silence after, heavy, strangely still,A landscape altered, bending to its will.It finally snapped! The silence in the room,As words unspoken now escaped their tomb.The mask fell off, revealing what had been,A raw, unvarnished, vulnerable skin.A liberation, bitter, sharp, and true,For burdens dropped, and visions come anew.Or shattered dreams, a scattered, broken heap,From depths unknown, where buried secrets sleep.The snapping sound, a marker sharp and clear,Dividing bravely, what was, and what is here.",

The last bugle's breathDissolves like mist into the waiting sky.Your boots, once tireless, now succumb to death,A silent farewell, as the years drift by.No cheers will greet you from the eager throng,No medal gleam upon your faded chest.Just a soft whisper, where the shadows throng,As earth embraces you, to find your rest.The battlefields you walked, now overgrown,With wildflowers swaying where the cannons roared.Your brothers-in-arms, to history's throne,Their sacrifice for freedom's cause adored.Yet in the quiet hum of twilight's grace,A memory stirs, of courage strong and true.A nameless hero, in this hallowed place,We bid you solace, as the day is through.Your youthful dreams, like embers, scattered wide,A tapestry unspun, a song unheard.But in the legacy where brave hearts ride,Your spirit lives, in every whispered word.So sleep, dear soldier, free from earthly strife,Beyond the sorrow, and beyond the pain.A silent guardian, in the dance of life,Til we shall meet, on freedom's distant plain.ADIEU, O soldier! Your vigil is done.",
