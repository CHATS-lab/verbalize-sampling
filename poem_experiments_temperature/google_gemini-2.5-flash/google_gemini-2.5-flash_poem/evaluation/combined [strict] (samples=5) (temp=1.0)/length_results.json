I would create a poem that contrasts the common understanding of Cinderella (glass slipper, ball, magic) with this deeper, more intrinsic interpretation. The poem would explore themes of inner strength, kindness, and resilience as the true 'beauty' and 'personality' that define a person, irrespective of their outward condition or magical intervention. It would highlight how these inherent qualities are what truly transform a life, rather than external factors. The structure would likely be quatrains with a consistent rhyme scheme, allowing for a steady exploration of the comparison between the superficial and the profound.
