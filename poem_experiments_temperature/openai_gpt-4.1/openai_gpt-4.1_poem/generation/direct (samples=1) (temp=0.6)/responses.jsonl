The world spun bright on carousels  Of candy colors, dizzy light,  While I sat quiet, counting shells  And tracing dreams in falling night.  I listened to the stories told  By wind in attic eaves, by rain\u2014  And learned to love the quiet cold  Of solitude, the gentle pain.  From childhood\u2019s hour I have not been  A child among the easy throng;  I\u2019ve walked in places few have seen,  And made the hush of dusk my song.  Yet in the twilight\u2019s gentle shade  I\u2019ve gathered stars from out the blue\u2014  And though apart, I am not afraid  To claim the world in my own view."}]}

Here, distance is measured by starlight and thirst,  By the ghost of a raincloud that faltered and burst,  By the echo of hooves on a moon-burnished plain,  And the longing for voices that never remain.  The mailbox stands watch on the red, rutted road,  A sentinel waiting for news never owed,  And nights are a quilt stitched in frost and regret,  With dreams that the city has long since forget.  Yet hope is a sapling that roots in the dust,  Fed by the promise of seasons and trust,  On a lonely selection far out in the West\u2014  A heart keeps on beating, and still, it is blessed."}]}

Each inhale is a silent anchor,  A pulse beneath the woven waves,  A patience pressed in pearled chambers,  A secret that the ocean saves.  She drifts within that silver lattice  Of undertow and memory,  Her breath a lantern, dim and steady,  Suspended in the shifting sea.  No storm can shatter such a stillness,  No dawn unravel what is kept\u2014  A spirit cradled by the current,  A breath when sheathed by the web of ebbs.  So let the world recede in ripples,  Let nightfall stitch its shadowed seams;  She floats, unmoored, within the silence\u2014  A dreamer breathing under dreams."}]}

For every hour he borrows, he bestows  A deeper root from which my spirit grows.  And though he steals, he leaves me, in his flight,  The grace to cherish both the dark and bright."}]}

A heartbeat echoes softly in the dark,  a rhythm only solitude has seen.  Her name dissolves into the hush of rain,  her worries drifting, feathered and unseen.  Beneath the boughs, she sheds her brittle pain,  becomes a whisper, somewhere in between.Yet even in the quiet, dawn will call\u2014  a golden thread unwinding through the gloom.  She\u2019ll rise, and let the world reclaim it all,  emerging from her self-constructed room.  But for a while, she lets the stillness bide\u2014  sometimes, she wants nothing but to hide."}]}

And though her roots are deep and old,  She\u2019s more than what the world supposes\u2014  A story waiting to be told  Beyond the perfect, blushing roses."}]}

You express loss in the tremble  Of hands folding away photographs,  In the hush between words,  In the salt of unshed tears.It is the art of holding absence\u2014  A careful tending of what remains:  A letter, a song, a garden untended,  A name spoken softly to the night.  And in the telling, the retelling,  You shape your sorrow into something  That fits inside your palm\u2014  A stone, a feather, a prayer\u2014  And carry it onward,  Heavy and light,  Never gone, never quite whole."}]}

The old cathedral\u2019s bells are still,  Their echoes folded in the dusk,  And prayers drift soft as thistle-will  Where hope once wore a brighter husk.  We turn to glass, to glowing screens,  To algorithms, numbers, news,  And trade our dreams for clever means,  Distracted by the things we choose.  Yet somewhere in the thinning mist,  A child lifts up a gaze so wide,  And wonders if the stars exist  To pin our longing to the sky.  For truth is not a single peak  But trembling dew on morning grass\u2014  A question only hearts can speak,  A light no shadow dares to pass.  As less on earth seek truth above,  The world grows dim with silent doubt,  But still, within the ones who love,  The flame of seeking won\u2019t burn out."}]}

I followed, bruised and uncertain,  Past thickets of memory,  Past the echo of old sorrows  That clung like mist above the surface.Night fell, and the stars stitched themselves  Into a map I could almost read\u2014  A promise that somewhere,  Beyond the next weary curve,  Your laughter waited, bright as dawn.At last, the river widened,  Its voice gentle as a touch.  You stood there, reflection trembling  Beside you in the dusk,  And I understood:  Every hardship, every winding mile,  Was the river\u2019s way of teaching me  The shape of longing, the worth of arrival,  The miracle of finding you at journey\u2019s end."}]}

My feet were glass and gravel; my heart, a battered drum\u2014  Still, the water called me forward, whispering, \u201cCome, come.\u201d  Mist curled around my ankles, cold as forgotten fears,  Yet hope flickered on the surface, trembling through the years.  Beneath the willow\u2019s weeping arms, I lost my sense of place,  But the river\u2019s silver promise beckoned me to chase.  I watched the moon\u2019s reflection fracture with every stride,  Each ripple a reminder of the doubts I could not hide.  Still, I carried on, believing that the current knew  Some secret path through sorrow, some route that led to you.  I passed stones carved with longing, reeds heavy with regret,  Yet the river\u2019s voice grew stronger, a song I can\u2019t forget.  At last, the banks grew gentle, the water slowed its run\u2014  And there you stood, as certain as the rising of the sun.  The journey marked my spirit, it etched me clear and true\u2014  For every mile of river, I found my way to you."}]}
