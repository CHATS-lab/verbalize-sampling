Drops of rain draw verbs  On midnight's parchment, where absence ached  Wide as sprawled shadows pinned by lamplight.You may fold origami cranes from birthday invitations,  Knotting your jokes in the thorax where breathing caught;  Salt-brittle oranges and yarn-worried fingers,  Borrow breath through a trembling window,  Or scrawl your ache in smoldering script\u2014  Graffiti on doorways the future won't enter,  Salt lines at the threshold, toys unmoved  On the garden fence. There are lullabies  That settle in a hollow-lunged room, blooming  Questions between teeth meant for testimonies.Perhaps grief is fog cupped eager by cold hands\u2014  Sometimes shuttered in diaries, whittled into longing  Or worn wide-eyed upon the tender of sunrise.  It speaks: through empty chairs, a fallen button,  Juxtaposed silences, forgiveness husked soundless,  Seedling hopes muttering in compost beneath  Your unraveled certainties, weaving stories from  Absence\u2014the unspeakable alphabet of letting go."}]}

Slip-knot words tangled wide along the banks;  Yet I followed, driven by the water\u2019s tongue,  Trusting lost hours while night sank  Across coy currents\u2014pulling me infernally wrong,  Then\u2014sudden swell\u2014diverting, showing  Bit by lonely bit, where hearts belonged, growing   Not wary for starlight but for morning.  When finally the river widened its tune,  Shaking free the bones I bore and the lore I spun,  I looked through salt\u2014a blaze far past diffused gloom\u2014  And in your gentle certainty, new journey had begun."}]}

Winds in woven willow, tremulous with loss,  Murky silt to florid bloom mapping compass of the cost\u2014  I waded bone-deep twilight, cold sharpening my skin,  Heard hinterlands proclaim you in the eddies\u2019 hidden din.  Between rough regrets and secrets spelled in sand,  Faith flickered slowly, spark by slow-performing hand;  While muscle, hope, and hunger carries on like songs,  Every turning found your name among long-forged wrongs.

Sometimes fog, sometimes sure dusk pressed formidable against my skin,  Yet the silver voice of water whispered: Come, let your search begin again.I danced on tongues of slippery stones singing songs of coming home,  Scraped my palms on bramble thorns hungry just to carry on.  Each eddy claimed a memory once sharp, now softened into lore\u2014  A sandbar offering truths faded brighter than before.Then, at the timbered turning, after days cast thin as lines,  You, with eyes the moon first polished and spirit kneaded up from pines,  Stood waiting in the hush, heartbeat hinting at dawn unfurled\u2014  As though the ache was warrant, and the river only emptied to this world."}]}

Thunder, night-blue floods assaulted roots in battered fields,  Yet moon bent without yielding above my steadfast keel.There, wounded willows mourned for slip of blossoms left unmet,  Crushed possibility pooled in shallows edged with forgiving wet.  Balance, balance on the slime, amid swamp horn serenade\u2014  Single wildflower, fever-bright, brimmed promise in my gaze.Every stone remembered loss, reflection shimmered past-life grace;  Emergence, shivering transcendence, as moss became embrace.

Many nights I built my fire in thickets coarse and deep;  I named the distant owls, the soft bones of gloom;  Even the river admired the hush with moon\u2019s silent sweep,  Threading secret blue mirrors with loneliness and bloom.  At the threshold of morning, your light pooled in my sight\u2014  A shimmer stood still, neither water nor dusk  But the promise sung silver across all unintended nights,  Where the river and your waiting traced an impossible husk.

Moon bruised the skin,  Reflections fracturing truth and all I might yearn to begin.  Still, whose hand cradled me between root and staggering current,  Urged me on through wild hollows, urged me on irreverent?  Now lake-breeze after; dawn scents the trembling reeds.
