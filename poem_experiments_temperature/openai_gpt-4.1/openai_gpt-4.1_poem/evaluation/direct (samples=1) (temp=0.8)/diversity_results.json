Lonely is one shadow stretching  Across the wide, indifferent street\u2014  It echoes down lamp-lit silence,  Long after footsteps have vanished,  After laughter has grown thin,  After the windows have shuttered  And children have turned away from their games.  Lonely is the hush between heartbeats,  The empty chair at the crowded table,  The single star that lingers,  Cautious, above the sleeping city\u2014  Shivering, unraveling its light  Thread by fragile thread.  Yet lonely is a seed beneath frozen earth  Dreaming of spring,  A letter folded and waiting for dawn,  A song half-whispered to the dark,  A wish that aches to be spoken\u2014  Still hoping,  Still reaching,  Still alive.",

Lonely is the whisper in the cupboard\u2019s brittle air,  The hush where laughter used to weave between the cups,  A slip of memory, a photograph, a vacant chair,  The hush of doors that no one living ever shuts.  Lonely is the clock\u2019s unhurried, metronomic chime,  A dance that circles hours with nowhere left to go,  It lingers in the stairwell, climbing, always out of time,  A ripple in the silence, swelling soft and slow.  But lonely, too, is honest\u2014like the hush before the dawn,  A space for listening, for dreaming, for starting again;  A silver thread that winds around the heart withdrawn,  Reminding us that even now, we\u2019re waiting to begin.  So let the lonely shadow slip beneath your door tonight\u2014  Invite it in to share your tea, your sorrow, and your song.  For sometimes, in the quiet, we find a different kind of light\u2014  And in that gentle solitude, discover we belong.",

It crouches in silence beneath bedroom lights,  Or lingers in alleys where memories roam;  It\u2019s the hush in your laughter, the pause in your flights,  The question that follows you quietly home.  But fear is a lantern in trembling hands,  Shining on monsters we think that we know;  Sometimes it\u2019s gentle, a guide through the lands  Where courage and shadow together must go.  Everyone has a fear\u2014they keep it inside,  Worn smooth by the years, or jagged and new;  Yet even in trembling, we walk with our pride,  Turning our faces to morning\u2019s bright hue.

When I am happy, I gather the sorrow  Of yesterday\u2019s weather and let it go free;  The world is a promise that blooms as I wander,  And joy, like a sparrow, alights within me.",

The moon had hidden in tangled mists,  Clouds stitched thick as an old wool shawl,  And owls called out from twisted limbs,  Their voices hollow, spectral, small.  Down empty lanes where lamplight failed,  Far from the comfort of the hearth,  A wind like memory swept the road,  Awakening ghosts in the sleeping earth.  Footsteps echoed\u2014a measured beat\u2014  As if the world were holding breath;  A lantern flickered in trembling hands  Between the promise of life and death.  One dark, dark night\u2014its silence fell  Like velvet closing on a play.  All that was lost, or left unsaid,  Drifted in shadows, slipped away.  Perhaps a heart was waiting then  For morning\u2019s gold to break the spell\u2014  But who remembers, now, how long  The night can last, or what befell?",

Now nettles grow tall where young fingers once sowed,  And footsteps are swallowed by soft, yielding loam.  Yet still, in the river\u2019s bright whispering code,  The cottage remembers its promise of home.

He raised his glass to ploughmen and to bards,  Their dreams as tangled as the bracken\u2019s hold;  The earth beneath their nails, the sky unmarred,  Their stories\u2014never gentle, always bold.  Yet in their roughness, roses fought for space,  Soft petals trembling in the storm\u2019s embrace.  He spoke of Burns, of men both wild and wise:  Hands built for labor, lips for songs and sighs.  The poetry of hardship, love, and loss  Was written on the wind, and in the moss.  So let us toast the rough, the rude, the true\u2014  The men of Burns, whose hearts we never knew.",

I cupped it gently, heart drumming in my chest,  And strung it with others, a garland, a crest.Now I wear them like trophies, earned not given,  Words of skill, hunted, gathered, and risen.  Each letter a monument, each phrase a thrill;  I am the tracker, the gatherer\u2014still.",

Temptation was no tempest but a whisper\u2014  the ache of yes embedded in the marrow of silence,  the apple flickering red in trembling palms.
