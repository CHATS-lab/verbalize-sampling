Yet, from window-creases and hidden alleys  the gaze is upward, seeking change arranged in the sky;  the forecast is a prayer, breathed  against the horizon and let go, again  into Kabul\u2019s wanting air.",

A larceny: he pilfers color bright  From cheeks once flushed with heat of fevered days\u2014  He sifts sunbeams to lukewarm, sifted light  That curls and puddles dull in autumn\u2019s haze.  Yet laughter lingered long upon these walls,  Its echo faint when night begins to creep;  Old photographs\u2014those trembling, golden calls\u2014  Still gather memory the hours cannot keep.  For Time may draw the bud from bloom to sere  And cloud, like frost, the fountain of delight,  But cannot steal what love engraves so clear  Or shadow dreams that sing against the night.  So, subtle thief, collect your spoils unseen;  Slide tapered shadows where you willed them be\u2014  I'll walk unhurried through what might have been,  And guard my flame against each bending tree.  For still within these bones, Desire burns,  And though Time steals, the heart's bright Spring returns.",
