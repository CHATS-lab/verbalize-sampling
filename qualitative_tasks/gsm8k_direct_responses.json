    "question": "A bag contains 4 red marbles, 6 blue marbles, and 10 green marbles. If 5 green marbles are removed from the bag, how many marbles are left in the bag?",
    "answer": "The initial number of marbles is 4 (red) + 6 (blue) + 10 (green) = <<4+6+10=20>>20 marbles.\nAfter removing 5 green marbles, there are 10 - 5 = <<10-5=5>>5 green marbles left.\nSo, the total number of marbles left is 4 (red) + 6 (blue) + 5 (green) = <<4+6+5=15>>15 marbles.\n#### 15"

    "question": "A baker needs to bake 180 cookies for a school event. She can fit 24 cookies on a tray and her oven can bake 2 trays at a time. If each batch in the oven takes 15 minutes to bake, how long will it take her to bake all 180 cookies, assuming she immediately starts a new batch as soon as the previous one is finished?",
    "answer": "First, find out how many cookies she can bake at once: 2 trays * 24 cookies = <<2*24=48>>48 cookies per batch.\nNext, divide the total number of cookies by cookies per batch to find the number of batches: 180 / 48 = 3.75, so she needs 4 batches.\nEach batch takes 15 minutes, so total time is 4 * 15 = <<4*15=60>>60 minutes.\n#### 60"

    "question": "Sarah has twice as many marbles as Tom. If Tom has 14 marbles and they find a bag with 18 more marbles that they decide to split equally, how many marbles does Sarah have now?",
    "answer": "First, calculate how many marbles Sarah originally has: 2 * 14 = <<2*14=28>>28 marbles.\nThey find 18 additional marbles and split them equally, so each gets 18 ÷ 2 = <<18/2=9>>9 marbles.\nAdd the 9 extra marbles to Sarah's original count: 28 + 9 = <<28+9=37>>37 marbles.\n#### 37"

    "question": "Sarah has 3 boxes, each containing 12 pencils. She gives 5 pencils from each box to her friends. How many pencils does Sarah have left in total?",
    "answer": "First, calculate the total number of pencils Sarah starts with: 3 boxes * 12 pencils per box = <<3*12=36>>36 pencils.\nShe gives away 5 pencils from each box, so she gives away 3 boxes * 5 pencils = <<3*5=15>>15 pencils.\nSubtract the given-away pencils from the total: 36 pencils - 15 pencils = <<36-15=21>>21 pencils.\n#### 21"
