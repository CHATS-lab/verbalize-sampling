      "First, Elsa starts with 40 marbles. She loses 3 at breakfast: 40 - 3 = 37. At lunch, she gives Susie 5 marbles: 37 - 5 = 32. In the afternoon, her mom gives her a bag of 12: 32 + 12 = 44. Susie gives Elsa twice as many marbles as she received at lunch. Since Susie got 5 marbles at lunch, she gives Elsa 2 x 5 = 10 marbles. 44 + 10 = 54. Final answer: ####54",
