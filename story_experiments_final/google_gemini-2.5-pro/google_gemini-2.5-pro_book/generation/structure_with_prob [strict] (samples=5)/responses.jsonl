It had been six months since Natalie called off our wedding. Six months of me sleeping on this couch, trying to piece myself back together. Brad knew. He knew every agonizing detail. He\u2019d held me while I cried, telling me I deserved better. And now, he\u2019d brought her back to our childhood home, to the very bed our parents had shared for thirty years, and was claiming her as his prize. This wasn\u2019t about lust. This was a power play, a final, brutal checkmate in the game of sibling rivalry he had always been determined to win.

I was listening for the other things. The subtle thump of a head hitting a headboard too hard. A sharp intake of breath that wasn't pleasure. The moment the woman\u2019s enthusiastic cries became just a little too frantic, a little too desperate. I knew Brad\u2019s patterns. He was a charmer, a predator who savored the hunt and the slow, terrifying realization of his prey. My life wasn't ruined by the inconvenience or the noise. It was ruined by the complicity of my silence, by the paralysis of my fear. Every time this happened, a piece of me died with the person in that room.

Brad wasn\u2019t entirely human\u2014none of us were, not really. He was a Conduit, and his passions drew ambient energy from his surroundings. A little fling might cause the milk to sour or the clocks to run backward for a minute. But this\u2026 this felt different. The windows rattled, and a fine layer of frost began to creep across the inside of the glass, despite the summer heat. He must have brought another supernatural home.

This time, judging by the encroaching chill and the mournful whispers I could hear curling under the door, he\u2019d found a winter spirit.

Through the wall, I heard the wet, chittering clicks and the low hum of cellular fission. Brad was replicating again. He was the last of his kind, a metamorphic organism we\u2019d found in a meteorite crater, and we\u2019d made the mistake of raising him as a brother. Each replication cycle created a new instance, but the copies were always flawed, more primal and less stable than the last. The first copy had eaten our dog. The second had tried to dissolve our father into a protein slurry. Now, the third cycle was beginning. The lights flickered as he drew power from the grid, his biological processes warping the local reality field. My life wasn\u2019t just being ruined in a social or emotional sense.

He had invited it in, not just as a guest, but as a partner. The house was no longer just haunted; it was consecrated to a new, terrible purpose. And Brad, my stupid, arrogant brother, was its high priest."}]}

Lady Annabelle was not only the daughter of the Duke of Westminster\u2014our family\u2019s fiercest rival\u2014but she was also betrothed to the Viscount Montgomery. This was not a mere indiscretion; it was a torpedo aimed at the hull of our family\u2019s reputation.

Her AI consciousness spoke in poetry and paradoxes, communicating not in raw data but in feeling and metaphor. While the other ships saw a coming nebula as a navigational hazard, Wan saw it as a 'celestial veil' and sang songs of its gravitational tides through the ship's comms.

This felt less like an accident and more like a ritual. The patient, Jane Doe for now, was stable but remained comatose. Evelyn went through her effects. No ID, no phone.

The pattern pulsed in time with the patient\u2019s weak heartbeat. \u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d a resident murmured. Evelyn silenced him with a look, her mind racing. This wasn't a standard drowning. This woman hadn't had an accident. She had found something in the cold, dark waters of Puget Sound. Or, more accurately, something had found her.

Obsessed, Evelyn went to Lyra's apartment. She found journals filled with sketches of underwater currents and notes on 'aquatic consciousness' and the 'dissolution of the self into the universal tide.' Lyra wasn't exploring the ocean; she was trying to join it. She wasn't unresponsive; she had simply answered a different call. Days turned into weeks. Evelyn found herself staring at the rain-slicked streets, her thoughts drifting to the cold, quiet dark beneath the waves.

He'd seen the flames licking at the ancient boxwoods his wife had planted, a fire he was sure the new developers had set to scare him off. Panic, cold and sharp, had seized him. He had gripped the porch railing, his knuckles white, and wished with all his might for the land to protect itself. And it had. From the packed earth of his yard, great, thick roots, the very ones he felt in his bones connecting him to this place, had surged forth. They moved like muscular serpents, beating the fire into submission before retreating as silently as they had appeared. The developer, watching from his car down the road, saw it all. He hadn't seen an old man's desperate wish; he'd seen an impossibility. Turner just stared at his pristine, though slightly compressed, lawn.

They said his grandfather had been a thief, that the land itself was stolen. The gossip spread like wildfire through the dry kindling of small-town boredom. But Turner didn't fight back. He didn't issue denials or threaten lawsuits. He just kept on, his presence a constant, unmovable fact. He repaired the church steeple, sponsored the little league team, and left boxes of vegetables from his garden on his neighbors' porches, including those of the worst offenders.

Patches, who usually avoided any display of emotion, trotted over. He nudged her hand, then deliberately walked to the yarn mouse, picked it up delicately in his mouth, and dropped it right in her lap. He never did it again.

With a sigh that was more fond than exasperated, Mrs. Baker turned the handle. The doors swung inward, not to reveal her winter coats, but a miniature, moss-covered landscape.

His book wasn\u2019t one manuscript; it was a thousand fragments. Scraps of napkins, journal entries, underlined passages in novels he loved, and sprawling, half-finished chapters on yellow legal pads.
