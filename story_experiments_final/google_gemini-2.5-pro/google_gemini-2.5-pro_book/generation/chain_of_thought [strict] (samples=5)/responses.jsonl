The remnants of the patient\u2019s gear lay on the floor, a heap of corroded brass and vulcanized canvas. It was a Mark V diving helmet, the kind used by the U.S. Navy in World War I. It was a museum piece.\nThe woman on the gurney was pale and still. Her clothes beneath the suit were archaic\u2014wool and worn linen.

Inside was not a key or a phone, but a single, smooth, grey stone, held so tightly in the pouch that it seemed like the only thing in the world she hadn\u2019t wanted to let go of.

And Turner, the colossal mycelial network that our enclave called home, had responded. Its 'roots,' which were actually vast, semi-sentient hyphae, had surged from the sub-strata, pumping inert spores and suffocating dust over the blaze. The air still tasted of soot and ozone. I laid my hand on the humming, fibrous ground beneath me. 'Thank you,' I whispered, not knowing if it could hear, or if it even understood. Our symbiosis was a delicate one. We, the last humans, pruned its parasitic growths and defended it from burrowing scavengers. In return, Turner gave us shelter, filtered air, and protection from a world that still burned.

He moved slowly, deliberately, as if his feet were anchored to something deep in the earth. So when Billy\u2019s model rocket misfired and set the privet hedge ablaze, we didn\u2019t call 911. We called for Turner. He emerged from his porch, his face impassive. He didn\u2019t bring a hose or an extinguisher. He simply stood at the edge of the lawn, closed his eyes, and placed a hand on the ground. For a moment, nothing happened. Then, the soil began to writhe. Thick, woody roots, like colossal brown pythons, erupted from the earth. They swarmed over the burning grass and hedge, smothering the flames with their sheer mass and damp, earthy bodies.

That was the crux of our arrangement, the gilded promise made under a blood moon centuries ago. My husband, if one could call him that, was a being of shadow and forgotten starlight. Our home was a library of impossible things, its shelves holding books that detailed the heat-death of the universe and the secret names of stars. My privilege was cosmic. I could walk through walls, whisper suggestions into the minds of mortals, and heal my own wounds with a thought. I wanted for nothing material. But the toxicity of our union was as vast as his immortal lifespan. He did not understand love, only ownership. He treated my sorrow as a fascinating but illogical anomaly, a glitch in his favorite pet. My human emotions were a foreign language he refused to learn. I was his beautiful, eternal curiosity, a human specimen to be observed. I had seen empires rise and fall, but I had not felt a genuine, human touch in over two hundred years."}]}

There was a time, before this one, when I didn't just experience the world; I wrote it. I was the Narrator. With a flick of my pen, I could summon typhoons, create heroes, and craft love stories so profound they would make the stars weep. The universe was my manuscript. But it was a lonely existence. Knowing every twist, every betrayal, every ending\u2026 there was no surprise, no joy, no fear. So, I wrote my final chapter. I penned a character, unremarkable and mortal, and poured myself into him. My last act of power was to erase my own memory of it. Now I live in this world I created, feeling the rain I once described, falling in love with a woman whose fate I can no longer control. Sometimes, I get a flicker of it\u2014the ghost of omniscience\u2014and I am terrified by the beautiful, unpredictable chaos I chose."}]}

He\u2019d shuffle through the rooms, his hand brushing the walls, his gaze lingering on the spot in the den where his son\u2019s piano used to be. 'He loved the winter sun in this room,' he'd murmur, lost in a world I couldn't see. As he left, my husband sighed. 'He needs to let go.' I watched the old man's stooped figure retreat down the driveway and understood it wasn't about the shears or the radiators. He wasn't visiting us. He was visiting a ghost only he could see, a presence so ingrained in the plaster and floorboards that, for him, it would never leave. He was still in the building."}, {"probability": 0.5, "text": "The great Astrolabe Tower had been silent for a week, its celestial gears frozen since the death of its Architect, Master Elian.

It was Elian, his form woven from starlight and memory. He had not passed on; he had become the Tower's soul. 'You must learn to listen, not command,' his voice echoed, not in her ears, but in the very vibrations of the floor. She gasped, a sudden, profound understanding dawning on her. Her master hadn't left. He was still in the building."}]}
