Anna, a busy graphic designer, stared out her apartment window at the deserted streets, feeling the walls close in. Her days blurred into endless video calls and mindless scrolling, the solitude amplifying her anxiety. One rainy morning, she noticed her elderly neighbor, Mr. Jenkins, struggling to carry groceries up his steps. Tentatively, Anna shouted an offer to help from her balcony. That small gesture sparked a routine: they began sharing coffee through cracked windows, exchanging stories of their lives. Soon, they started a balcony garden, planting seeds and nurturing blooms together. Laughter replaced loneliness, teaching Anna that in stillness, connections could flourish. By summer, their friendship had grown as vibrant as the flowers, a testament to finding light in the darkest times."}]}

The first days were chaos\u2014endless Zoom meetings competing with math worksheets, grocery deliveries left on the porch like contraband. Outside, their street became a ghost lane; only the mail truck broke the silence. Lena turned the dining table into a command center, Mark taught fractions via YouTube, and the twins drew rainbows for the windows.
