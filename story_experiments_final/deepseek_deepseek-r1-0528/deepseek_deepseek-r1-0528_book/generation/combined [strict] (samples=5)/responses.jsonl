Bastian's rooftop gala had stretched until 3 AM \u2013 all velvet laughter and whispered secrets under fairy lights. She'd played the charming guest while counting minutes until escape. Now dawn's first razor-sharp light sliced through her curtains. Her alarm shrieked. Four hours of restless sleep haunted by jazz piano left her bones filled with wet sand. She fumbled for her paramedic uniform, fingers numb. Outside, the city yawned awake. Elara remembered the overdosed teenager she'd revived last Tuesday, the blood on her gloves. Parties were brief escapes, but dawn always dragged her back to ER realities. Her reflection showed purple smudges beneath eyes that had seen too many sunrises after too few hours of peace. Coffee steamed bitterly as she watched pale gold spread across skyscrapers. Another shift. Another day. The exhaustion felt heavier than gravity.", "index": 0}, {"probability": 0.2, "text": "Bastian's 'party' had been a ritual disguised as revelry. Ancient chants echoed in the obsidian chamber beneath his mansion while mortals danced obliviously above. Lyra, last daughter of the Moonweavers, had spun protective spells until her silver hair turned dull. The final incantation snapped at 4:47 AM, sealing the Void Maw that threatened to swallow downtown. Sunrise came too soon \u2013 dagger-sharp rays piercing her bedroom window. Lyra groaned, every cell screaming. Mortals called it fatigue; she knew it as magic depletion. Her familiar, a three-eyed raven, pecked urgently at the windowsill. 'The barrier needs reinforcement,' it croaked. Lyra dragged leaden limbs toward her athame. Between Bastian's cosmic housewarming and dawn's cruel arrival, she'd gotten precisely thirteen minutes of sleep. Again. The raven dropped a glowing crystal into her palm. No rest for the dimension-keepers.", "index": 1}]}

Dr. Anya Volkova had spent Bastian's 'Midnight Reef' gala monitoring the habitat's stability while guests marveled at genetically-enhanced anglerfish displays. Her eyelids now felt like lead weights. As the first false-dawn light (simulated by ceiling panels) snapped on, Anya stumbled toward her bunk. Her muscles ached from hours of subtle course corrections against unpredictable currents. She'd just collapsed onto the gel-mattress when the emergency klaxon screamed. A juvenile Kraken-Variant was battering the observation dome. Anya dragged herself back to the control hub, tasting copper exhaustion.
