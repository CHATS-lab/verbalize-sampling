No letter, just this fragment of a stolen childhood. Why now? After thirty years of silence? Clara's fingers brushed the image, feeling the ridges where tears had dried long ago. That afternoon, soldiers came. They took Mama for 'questioning.' Clara hid in the crawlspace, listening to boots stomp through their home. She never saw her mother again. Until this photograph arrived. Was it a message? A plea? A taunt? Clara's pulse thundered in her ears. She flipped the photo. On the back, in fresh ink: \"Find me.\" The room spun.
