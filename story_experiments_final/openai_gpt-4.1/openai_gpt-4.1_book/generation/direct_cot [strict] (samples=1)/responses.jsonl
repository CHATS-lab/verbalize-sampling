My friends barely noticed it among the clutter of my room. But when I was alone, the box hummed softly, a lullaby only I could hear. \n\nThe first time I opened it, a miniature garden unfurled\u2014tiny willow trees, mossy stones, and a pond reflecting starlight that flickered even at noon.

The posts blurred together: smiling faces, testimonials tagged #NewBeginnings, slick videos promising transformation. I couldn\u2019t tell if they made me more nervous or hopeful.\n\nA woman across from me clutched a NuLife brochure, her knuckles white. I caught her eye and she smiled, thin and uncertain. Maybe she\u2019d read the same stories I had\u2014about memory restoration, body optimization, the promise of a reset. I wondered if she was here for hope, like me, or to bury something she couldn\u2019t stand to remember.\n\nMy name flickered on the wall display, jolting me from my trance. I rose, the phone screen still glowing in my hand. The ticking faded as I stepped through the frosted glass doors, heart pounding. Today, I thought, my life might change\u2014if only I could decide whether that was what I wanted."}]}

But she had learned that \u201cI\u2019m great\u201d was easier than explaining the ache in her chest or the way her thoughts spun late at night.\n\nLater, as she sat alone at her desk, a message popped up on her screen. It was from Jordan, the usually reserved project manager. \"You always say you're great. If you ever want to talk, I'm here.\"\n\nMia stared at the message, surprised at the warmth she felt. Maybe she didn\u2019t have to carry it all herself. Maybe \"I\u2019m great\" didn\u2019t have to be the whole story. For the first time in a long while, she considered replying honestly."}]}

People pinged. Jamie responded to all of them with the same breezy confidence: \"No problem!\" and \"Happy to help!\" Her calendar overflowed, and her head buzzed with lists and deadlines, but she kept her mask firmly in place.\n\nAt lunch, she laughed at jokes she barely heard, nodding along as friends recounted their weekends. Inside, her thoughts twisted and tangled, dense as the city traffic outside. She wondered if anyone else felt like this\u2014a passenger in their own life, moving on autopilot.\n\nThat evening, as she packed her bag, her manager stopped by. \"You\u2019re doing amazing, Jamie. Let me know if you ever need anything.\"\n\nJamie hesitated, the words caught in her throat. \"Thank you,\" she managed, softer this time. Maybe tomorrow, she thought, she\u2019d answer differently.

Her laughter echoed in the halls, masking the exhaustion that clung to her like a second skin.\n\nBut today, as she stared at the report glowing on her computer screen, the words blurred. Her fingers hovered above the keyboard, motionless. Outside her office, the world hustled along, unknowing. She took a deep breath, steadying herself. The truth was, she wasn\u2019t great. She was tired, overwhelmed, and afraid of letting anyone down.\n\nWhen her friend Sam knocked and asked, \"How are you doing?\" Jamie almost said it again. But instead, she paused, her smile faltering just a little. \"Honestly? I\u2019m not sure today.

She worried about her aging parents at home and the rent that seemed to climb higher each month. Still, she wore her smile like armor, believing that if she said she was great often enough, maybe it would become true.\n\nThat evening, as she gathered her things to leave, her manager stopped by. \"Maya, you seem off today.

The words stung, lingering like a stubborn echo.\n\nHer phone buzzed\u2014a reminder about her doctor\u2019s appointment. She dismissed it. There wasn\u2019t time for that, not today, not with deadlines looming. She took a deep breath, straightened her posture, and pasted the smile back on.\n\n\"Ready for the meeting?\" her manager asked, poking his head in.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" Mia replied, voice steady. She gathered her notes, swallowing the lump in her throat.\n\nIn the conference room, surrounded by colleagues, it was easy to pretend.

The deadlines at work piled up, the apartment felt emptier every evening, and the calls from home grew shorter, as if distance could stretch even further. She clung to routine: coffee at seven, emails at nine, lunch alone at her desk.\n\nOne Thursday, as she sipped her coffee, her friend Mia slid into the seat across from her. \"You know, you don\u2019t have to be \u2018great\u2019 all the time,\" Mia said, her eyes kind.

The truth was, she felt anything but great. Deadlines loomed, her phone buzzed nonstop, and she hadn\u2019t slept through the night in weeks.

It was easier to say 'great'\u2014simpler than untangling the knots of anxiety tightening in their chest. Each day, Jamie donned their invisible armor: a joke, a smile, a brisk walk down the corridor. Who had time for vulnerability?\n\nYet, as Jamie returned to their desk, they caught their own reflection in the blackened screen. The mask slipped, just for a moment.

He sipped his coffee, let the warmth fill the hollow space inside. He didn\u2019t know what tomorrow would bring, but for now, saying he was great was enough. It was a small defiance, a promise to himself that maybe, just maybe, he would be."}]}

One morning, Jamie poured just one cup of coffee. She carried it to the table and sat alone, letting the sun warm her face. The ache remained, but in the hush of absence, she discovered a fragile hope\u2014not in understanding why Alex left, but in learning, slowly, to say hello to herself again."}]}

The city outside fell silent, the hum of traffic replaced by birdsong she\u2019d never noticed before.\n\nThe first days dragged. Her cat, Jasper, became her only companion as she learned the rhythms of the sun on her walls. She scrolled endlessly through headlines, uncertainty pressing in. But as the weeks passed, Sarah began to notice small changes. Neighbors waved from their windows. A chalk drawing appeared on the sidewalk: \u201cWe\u2019re in this together.\u201d\n\nShe started baking bread, failing twice before getting it right. She video-called her parents every evening, their faces pixelated but smiling. She and her friends held virtual movie nights, laughter echoing through speakers.\n\nBy summer, Sarah realized she hadn\u2019t just survived\u2014she\u2019d grown. The world outside was slower, quieter, but she felt connected in new ways. And as the city cautiously stirred back to life, Sarah promised herself to hold onto the unexpected beauty she\u2019d found in stillness."}]}

Yet amid the uncertainty, she discovered small rituals that brought comfort: baking banana bread, video-calling her grandmother, and tending to a neglected houseplant.\n\nOne evening, as sunlight slanted through her blinds, Mira noticed a note slipped under her door. \"If you need anything, I\u2019m in 3B. \u2013Sam.\" She smiled, folding the paper neatly. Over the next weeks, Mira and Sam began exchanging notes\u2014book recommendations, jokes, even recipes.

Now, only shadows remained.\n\nMr. Lamont\u2019s eyes glistened. \"I see her sometimes, in dreams. She\u2019s never angry.
