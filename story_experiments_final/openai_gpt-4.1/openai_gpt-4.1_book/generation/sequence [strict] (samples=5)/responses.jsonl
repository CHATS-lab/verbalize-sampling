Brad\u2014always the golden child, always the source of chaos. The walls, once sanctuary, now seemed thin as paper. Mom\u2019s shriek followed, then Dad\u2019s heavy footsteps. I glanced at my phone: 8:03 a.m. On a school day. Classic Brad. As the household exploded into a cacophony of scandal, I quietly tiptoed to the back door, backpack in hand. Maybe today would be the day I finally ran away, at least until the whispers died down. But as I reached for the doorknob, Brad\u2019s voice boomed from upstairs, \"Hey, can I get some privacy?\" I rolled my eyes. Maybe one day, I\u2019d be the sibling making headlines.

I slammed my laptop shut, abandoning the college application essay I\u2019d spent hours perfecting. Brad\u2019s escapades would be the headline at dinner, eclipsing my scholarship news, my debate win, or anything remotely about me. Mom would sigh, Dad would grumble, and I\u2019d dissolve into the background. Tim, meanwhile, would bask in the chaos he\u2019d set loose. That\u2019s how it always went.

The year before, he dyed the pool green. Now, this. I glanced at the sea of relatives, mouths agape, forks frozen midair. Aunt Marjorie dropped her casserole. Uncle Ron choked on his iced tea. Brad, blissfully oblivious, strolled in moments later, a smirk on his face. \"Did I miss something?\" he asked. I wanted to disappear, to sink through the floorboards. But then Grandpa chuckled, breaking the tension. \"Well, at least the boy\u2019s got spirit!\" Laughter erupted, and suddenly, the spotlight felt a little less harsh.

I was supposed to have the house to myself for my virtual art show, the one time my work would be in the spotlight instead of Brad\u2019s antics. But now, thanks to Milo\u2019s broadcast, every neighbor within a two-block radius probably knew. Mom sprinted upstairs, Dad dropped his mug, and my phone pinged with a message: 'Is Brad really\u2026?' I closed my eyes and counted to ten. Maybe it was time to embrace the chaos. With a deep breath, I set up my laptop, hit 'go live,' and let the world watch as my family unraveled in the background. It wasn\u2019t the show I\u2019d planned, but it was real.

My brother, sensing my humiliation, does a victory lap around the table, narrating Brad\u2019s supposed romantic exploits in vivid detail. Jamie laughs, and suddenly the embarrassment feels lighter.

I glare at my little brother, who stands at the top of the stairs with a smirk, proud of the chaos he\u2019s unleashed. This is his specialty: arriving just in time to blow up my carefully constructed plans. Last month, he crashed my Zoom interview; the month before, he live-streamed my dance practice to his followers. Now, he\u2019s turned my private life into family theater.

He had a sixth sense for showing up at the precise moment my life was about to get interesting\u2014or humiliating.\n\n\"Is it true, Brad?\" my grandma asked, eyes shining with mischievous curiosity. I mumbled something about reading a book, but Tyler was already spinning tales, embellishing every detail with wild hand gestures.

Their friendship was built on unspoken agreements and mutual respect, a silent pact in a world too eager for gossip.

Nick\u2019s queerness remained his own, never fodder for the Chronicle\u2019s rampant rumor mill. Their companionship deepened, rooted in trust and quiet understanding.

She recognized early on what Nick\u2019s nervous glances and careful silences meant, but she chose empathy over curiosity. Together, they forged an alliance built on trust and shared late-night shifts. Bailey never let slip what she knew; Nick\u2019s queerness was never a whisper in the breakroom, never a headline in the gossip columns. Instead, they laughed over takeout, swapped stories of heartbreak and hope, and watched each other\u2019s backs. With Bailey\u2019s discretion, Nick learned to live more authentically, knowing some secrets deserved to be kept, not because they were shameful, but because they belonged to him\u2014and to a friend who understood their true value."}]}

But already, Andy felt the weight of the wrongness. The question didn\u2019t fit the shape of the horror that had unfolded.

The truth was that some acts tear holes in reality, and no string of reasons can stitch them up again.

Andy glanced at the others in the room, all searching for answers that wouldn\u2019t come. He saw the haunted look in their eyes, the way they clung to routine as if it might anchor them. The story wasn\u2019t about blame or understanding, but about surviving the aftermath. Andy resolved to stop asking why and start asking how\u2014to move forward, to rebuild, to forgive.

The real question, Andy thought, was \"Who are we now?\" After the fire, after the confession, after the secret burst open like a wound. The man they thought they knew had revealed something unrecognizable, and the community\u2019s reflection in the mirror would never be quite the same. As Andy watched the dust motes swirl in the late afternoon sun, he realized that understanding might come, or it might not.
