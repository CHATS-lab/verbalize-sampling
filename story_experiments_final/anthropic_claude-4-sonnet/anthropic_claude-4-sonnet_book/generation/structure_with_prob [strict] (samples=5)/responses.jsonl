I saw the moment I'd first skimmed money from the charity fund, telling myself it was just a loan. I saw the elaborate justifications I'd constructed, the way I'd convinced myself I deserved that money more than the homeless shelter it was meant for. Layer by layer, I peeled back the self-deception until I reached the rotten core: I had become someone who could steal from the hungry and sleep soundly.

Now it was her turn to prove she belonged at the conservatory, that the scholarship hadn't been a mistake.\n\nShe closed her eyes, feeling the familiar weight of the keys beneath her fingers.

Outside, rain pelted the warehouse windows like bullets. \"You sure about this, cousin?\" August whispered, knowing that this hand would determine whether he'd save his grandmother's farm or lose everything his family had built.

He was the artist in our family.\" They worked in comfortable silence, two broken souls finding solace in shared creation.

August pressed his palm against the next symbol\u2014a spiral within a triangle\u2014and gasped as images flooded his mind. Cities floating in purple skies. Beings of pure light communicating through color. A dying civilization's desperate message encoded in mathematics that transcended language. \"They're trying to warn us,\" August whispered, his hand still burning from the contact. \"About what's coming to Earth.\" Julian's face was pale in the artifact's pulsing glow. \"The climate data, the magnetic field fluctuations\u2014it's all connected, isn't it?\" August nodded grimly. \"We have maybe six months before the solar storm hits.

Tonight, Julian had convinced him to share his own words. \"This one's called 'Letters to My Younger Self,'\" August announced, his voice barely above a whisper. The room fell silent. He began to read, his words painting pictures of a boy who felt invisible, who found refuge in late-night writing sessions and dog-eared poetry books.

But Julian, his roommate and self-appointed life coach, had finally cornered him tonight. \"You can't keep hiding your talent behind caffeine and excuses,\" Julian had whispered earlier.

He'd been the driver that night, the one who'd walked away with barely a scratch while Julian spent three months learning to walk again. Words had failed them both since then\u2014too many unsaid apologies, too much unprocessed guilt. But Dr. Martinez had insisted that sometimes healing required a different language entirely. August dipped his brush in white paint, then black, creating a stark horizon line across the center. Above it, he painted a single star\u2014small, distant, but undeniably present. Below, he added gentle waves, not the violent crash Julian had depicted, but the steady rhythm of tides that always return to shore.
