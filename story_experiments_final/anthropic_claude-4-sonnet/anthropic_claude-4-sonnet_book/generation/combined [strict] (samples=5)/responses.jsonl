Twenty years had passed since that terrible summer when her best friend Hannah disappeared. The town had whispered the same poison then\u2014that Hannah had somehow invited her fate, that her early development made her culpable in her own tragedy. Now, as a bestselling author and child advocacy lawyer, Zara used fiction to tell the truths that courtrooms couldn't handle. Her latest novel featured twelve-year-old protagonist Luna, whose supernatural ability to see people's true intentions revealed the grotesque thoughts of adults around her. Through Luna's eyes, readers experienced the horror of being blamed for existing in a body that others sexualized without consent. The book's climax showed Luna using her powers to expose a network of predators who justified their crimes by claiming their victims were \"asking for it.\" Critics called it \"fantasy with a purpose\"\u2014a genre-bending masterpiece that used magical realism to illuminate real-world injustices. Zara smiled, knowing Hannah would have loved seeing their story help other children find their voices.", "probability": 0.4, "index": 3}]}
