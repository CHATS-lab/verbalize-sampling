My wrists might break, my vision might dim, but a man whose blood sings with a relic is not yet subdued.

All this because I\u2019d borrowed\u2014temporarily\u2014the sacred corkscrew of Saint Vinifred for last night\u2019s clandestine wine tasting. 'It was research,' I protested, spraying crimson punctuation across Gerhardt\u2019s sandals. He looked appalled; not at the blood, but the blasphemy. The abbot approached, brandishing the corkscrew like a scepter. 'Explain yourself, Novice Bastian.' My mind raced. I could confess, or I could improvise. I chose door number two. 'Your Holiness, I was testing the artifact\u2019s durability. Imagine if invaders tried to open\u2026 uh\u2026 the Holy Bottle unworthily!' A hush. Then, miraculously, a nod. 'A valid concern,' the abbot mused. 'Release him.' The monks obeyed, albeit grudgingly. As I stood, woozy, the abbot added, 'Next time, test on non-vintage sacrament.' I bowed, clutching my throbbing brow. Note to self: when salvation hangs by a corkscrew, stick to bread. Preferably without daggers.\"\"\""}]}

Ancient roots, older than civilization, surged upward as if called home. They spread in concentric waves, pressing fires into submission, turning hunger into mulch. When the last ember died, the roots remained, shaping a labyrinth of wooden ribs that sheltered us from the ash winds. Turner staggered, bark peeling from his forearms.

Her apartment thrummed like a backstage just before the curtain rises: crumb-speckled floors, finger-paint constellations on the fridge, lullaby mobiles tangled with superhero capes. I\u2019d come straight from a sterile high-rise where silence smelled like bleach. The first evening, Jacob handed me a plastic microphone and declared me co-host of his imaginary talk show; the dog stole one shoe, demanding fetch as ransom; Max accepted my pinky as a pacifier. After they finally collapsed, Fran and I drank microwaved cocoa and talked about the years we\u2019d lost to deadlines, illnesses, men who didn\u2019t read books. Between her yawns she admitted she feared the noise would scare me off. I told her the racket felt like a heart still beating. At dawn Max squeaked awake; Jacob trumpeted a kazoo salute; the dog barked harmony. I buried my face in a couch cushion and laughed, realizing I hadn\u2019t planned where to go next because, quietly, I hoped nowhere else would sound this alive."}]}

Jacob provided the percussion to unlatch the sonic lock, while baby Max\u2019s sleepless babble reset the coordinates.
