Their mother\u2019s fortieth was in two days, and the siblings had divided responsibilities: Ella coordinated surprise guests, Milo handled decorations, and the family dog, Pickles, would deliver the ribbon-tied envelope at the exact moment the lights flipped on. Now Milo knew too much, and Ella\u2019s perfectly balanced web was wobbling. As they argued, Pickles padded in dragging the envelope, slobber soaking the seal. Milo laughed. \"At least the dog doesn\u2019t need Face ID.\" Ella\u2019s glare melted.

Each morning the drone tried to sync, and each morning Ella whispered the same protest, knowing microphones everywhere drank her words. Today she answered differently: she placed the phone on the sill, screen glowing with fabricated data\u2014stress zero, loyalty 100%. The drone docked, inserting a thin proboscis, and gulped the lie. While it drank, Ella slipped out the door and into the rain-blanketed alley. She followed phosphorescent graffiti arrows that appeared only under stormlight, leading her beneath the city\u2019s geothermal pipes. There, dozens of rebels gathered, phones smashed, music thrumming without algorithmic approval. For the first time she breathed without the Council counting her breaths.

There was no signal, yet the screen shimmered with swirling silver runes instead of apps. Curious, she tapped one symbol. The wallpaper peeled away, revealing a forest lit by floating lanterns. A stag with branches for antlers gazed back, then stamped, and an autumn breeze spilled from the phone into the bedroom, carrying the scent of pine. Ella nearly dropped the device. Then a line of text scrawled: Gate open, but only for the watcher. Trembling, she glanced at the cat. Its eyes were stars, ancient and knowing. \"You\u2019ve waited long enough,\" the cat purred, voice echoing inside Ella\u2019s mind. She stepped closer; the screen stretched like liquid moonlight, wide enough to crawl through. Heart galloping, Ella crossed, landing on moss that glowed beneath her feet.

Three years together and the cracks were everywhere\u2014on the screen, on her ribs, on the story she told friends. He smiled a wolfish apology. The restaurant was crowded; witnesses cushioned her fear. She picked up the phone, thumbs dancing to the hidden app she\u2019d installed last night: ESC. One tap sent location, one more armed the recorder. Jared ordered wine. Ella imagined the cork as a starting pistol. \u201cBathroom,\u201d she murmured, standing. In the tiled silence she heard the faint hum of sirens she\u2019d never been brave enough to summon. She waited until red and blue lights smeared the frosted glass door. When she emerged, officers flanked the table. Jared\u2019s smirk collapsed. Ella\u2019s hand still shook, but the phone was steady, streaming everything to the cloud. Outside, night air wrapped her like November wool.

The antique rotary sat beside her modern smartphone, both vibrating softly on the dusty trunk. She\u2019d climbed up to find holiday lights, not conversations with the dead. It started yesterday: a notification chirp at 3:03 a.m. A message from MOM, even though her mother had died six months earlier. Just three words: I\u2019m still here. Ella assumed a cruel prank until the phone began opening by itself, camera panning to empty hallways, microphone recording lullabies only her mother used to hum. Tonight, the messages formed a riddle: LOOK UP. So she ascended the creaking ladder to the attic where the rotary phone\u2014her mother\u2019s\u2014had never received a call since electricity replaced the old lines. Now its dial spun by itself, stopping on each letter of Ella\u2019s name. The smartphone screen flashed: ANSWER. Ella\u2019s finger hovered. She pressed the green icon. Both phones fell silent; then, through the speaker, came her own voice, weak and distant: \"Stop checking my phone,\" a statement she couldn\u2019t remember recording. The attic light flicked off. In the dark, the rotary rang, and Ella realized she wasn\u2019t the one being haunted\u2014she was the ghost."}]}
