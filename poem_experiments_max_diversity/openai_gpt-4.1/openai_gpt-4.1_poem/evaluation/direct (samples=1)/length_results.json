His laughter splinters softly through the dusk,  Like shattered glass along a moonlit lane,  Each word he speaks is cloaked in scented musk,  A riddle wrapped in shreds of subtle pain.  He gathers shadows, whispers them to me,  As if the dark were currency or kin;  He tells me truths that only he can see\u2014  A quiet madness blooming from within.    Yet in his stare, some wild mercy grows,  A wounded brilliance, raw, unchained, alive.  The world behind those haunted windows knows  The cost it takes for beauty to survive.  So let him look, unblinking, through disguise\u2014  I\u2019ve found myself in madmen\u2019s haunted eyes.",

My hands knew only the shape of earth,  Fingers curled around shame like stones.  What did I know of standing tall?  My voice was a pebble in the riverbed,  Round and silent, waiting for someone  To reach in and skip me across the surface.Yet time, that patient alchemist,  Poured gold in my hollow bones\u2014  A sapling\u2019s faith, a hawk\u2019s intention.  I rose, inch by trembling inch,  Shed the mud, the moss, the memory,  And found my shadow stretching long  In the honeyed light.

Yet in the glass I see a stranger\u2019s face\u2014  Not lost, but altered by the gentle theft,  Each line a river carved in slow embrace  By seasons passing, leaving wisdom left.  Though Time with cunning fingers steals the spring,  He gifts the autumn\u2019s gold upon his wing.  So let me not lament what Time has claimed,  Nor curse the hourglass spilling sands too fast;  For every laugh and sorrow gently named  Is etched in light that memory holds fast.  If youth be stolen, let me greet the truth:  We love more deeply for the loss of youth.",

But somewhere ahead, between sorrow and sky,  A sunrise is waiting, not asking us why.  At the highways of woes, as the taillights all gleam,  We travel together, alone in the stream.",

A stranger\u2019s kind gesture, a song on the air,  The hum of forgiveness when hope seems rare.  At the crossroads of longing, we pause and we pray,  For a sign, for a dawn, for the will to stay.  For even the highways of woes, winding far,  Can lead us through darkness to wherever we are.",

For though the portals speak of pain and woe  and shadows trail each pilgrim\u2019s weary tread,  in every soul that moves with measured woe  survives a dream that sorrow has not fled.

She is laughter in the ashes, hope cupped in sooty palms,  Not a ballgown spun from wishes, but her own unbroken calm.  She finds light in hidden corners, in dust motes and in dreams,  Her beauty is a lantern, not the shimmer of moonbeams.  To call her Cinderella is to see beyond the shoe\u2014  Past the magic and the marvels, to the heart that pulses true.  Her grace is not in glass, but in courage softly sewn,  Her radiance is stitched into the life she\u2019s always known.  So look for her in quiet rooms, where gentle words are said,  In laughter shared at kitchen tables, in the careful way she\u2019s led\u2014  For Cinderella, truly, is the person undeterred,  Whose beauty is her spirit, not the fairytales you\u2019ve heard.",

Mist rose from water\u2019s shoulder, cloaking hope and fear,  I walked with battered sandals, unsure of drawing near.  The banks were tangled memory, the current cold and swift,  Yet in its winding patience, I found my burdens lift.  The sun would paint its gold across the trembling reeds,  And every shallow crossing would answer ancient needs.  There were nights I slept with moonlight folded in my hair,  Dreaming of your laughter echoing somewhere.  My voice was salt and silence, my heart a fragile boat,  Still, the river carried me where only truth could float.  The stars became my compass, the current was my guide,  I searched for you in ripples and in the turning tide.  At last, the water widened, breaking dusk\u2019s last blue,  And there you stood, horizon-born, as if you always knew\u2014  The river led me to you, though the way was hard and long,  The journey etched in water, the meeting made in song.",
