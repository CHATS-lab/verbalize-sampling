It's the kind of joke you'd hear from a friendly uncle at a family gathering, or perhaps from a quirky professor trying to lighten the mood in a lecture hall.

It\u2019s a clever play on words that requires a tiny bit of critical thinking to connect the dots, making the payoff slightly more satisfying for some.
