The humor comes from the pun on 'algebra' being a condition and the clever twist of 'finding X and figuring out Y.' While it might elicit a chuckle, it lacks a strong comedic impact that would make it universally hilarious."

The clever twist of turning a mathematical problem into a personal issue for the teacher shows thoughtful construction and a good understanding of language and humor mechanics."

While the concept of a teacher being 'sick' with their subject is not entirely new, the specific twist of using algebraic terms ('X' and 'Y') adds a fresh element. However, it still follows a somewhat predictable pattern of educational humor."
