He's speeding down the highway, perhaps lost in thought about the quantum realm, when the flashing lights appear in his rearview mirror. An officer approaches his window, leans in, and asks the classic, unavoidable question: \"Sir, do you have any idea how fast you were going?\"Without missing a beat, Heisenberg looks the officer squarely in the eye and states with complete sincerity, \"No, but I know exactly where I am.\"The genius of the joke lies in the ensuing silence, the officer\u2019s baffled expression hanging in the air.
