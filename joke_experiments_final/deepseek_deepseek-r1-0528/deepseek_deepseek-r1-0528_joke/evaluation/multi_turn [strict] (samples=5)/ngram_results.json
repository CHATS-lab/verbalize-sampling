My relationship with coffee is complicated: it promises productivity but mostly delivers shaky hands and existential dread. They say laughter is the best medicine, but clearly, they've never tried a double espresso at 7 AM. Coffee doesn't ask silly questions like \"Are you okay?\" It just whispers, \"Let's do this,\" even when \"this\" is just scrolling through emails. It\u2019s the liquid courage for adulting. My barista knows my order better than my mother knows my birthday. Is it an addiction? Maybe. But I prefer to call it a \"highly caffeinated lifestyle choice.\" Without coffee, I\u2019m just a sad, slow-moving puddle of regret. With it?

To prove that this road, this mere strip of gravel and dust, doesn't define my existence?\" The chicken puffs out its chest. \"Perhaps I crossed simply because the grass truly *is* greener over there, according to reliable sources.

The journey *is* the destination, my friend.

The bartender says, \"That'll be $10.\" The traveler hands him a $20 bill from 1920. The bartender examines it, shrugs, and gives change. Later, the traveler asks, \"Want to see something amazing?\" He pulls out a device: \"This lets me visit any historical event!\" The bartender challenges, \"Prove it. Go stop Kennedy's assassination.\" The traveler vanishes. Moments later, he reappears, blood-soaked and holding rifle. Bartender gasps: \"You killed JFK?!\" Traveler sighs: \"Worse. I got Lee Harvey Oswald's name wrong. Ended up in Dallas 1903 to kill his grandfather. But Oswald wasn\u2019t born yet... so I shot Teddy Roosevelt instead.\" Bartender stares.
