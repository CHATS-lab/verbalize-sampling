But let me elaborate on atomic untrustworthiness. Atoms constantly rearrange themselves without permission, form suspicious bonds under cover of darkness, and disappear into quantum uncertainty when observed. They're the ultimate con artists of physics - claiming to be solid while being 99.999% empty space. Even their nucleus is surrounded by electron groupies orbiting like paparazzi. Worst of all? They've infiltrated literally every molecule in existence. You can't even drink water without swallowing their lies. That H2O might promise hydration, but it's clearly two hydrogen atoms conspiring with an oxygen. Frankly, the periodic table is just their organized crime network.
