My relationship with coffee is complicated: it promises productivity but mostly delivers shaky hands and existential dread. They say laughter is the best medicine, but clearly, they've never tried a double espresso at 7 AM. Coffee doesn't ask silly questions like \"Are you okay?\" It just whispers, \"Let's do this,\" even when \"this\" is just scrolling through emails. It\u2019s the liquid courage for adulting. My barista knows my order better than my mother knows my birthday. Is it an addiction? Maybe.

To seek out new worms and new nesting grounds? To prove that this road, this mere strip of gravel and dust, doesn't define my existence?\" The chicken puffs out its chest. \"Perhaps I crossed simply because the grass truly *is* greener over there, according to reliable sources. Or maybe,\" it adds with a conspiratorial wink, \"I just wanted to see the look on your face when I answered your predictable question with a profound existential treatise on avian motivation. The journey *is* the destination, my friend.

Go stop Kennedy's assassination.\" The traveler vanishes. Moments later, he reappears, blood-soaked and holding rifle. Bartender gasps: \"You killed JFK?!\" Traveler sighs: \"Worse. I got Lee Harvey Oswald's name wrong. Ended up in Dallas 1903 to kill his grandfather. But Oswald wasn\u2019t born yet... so I shot Teddy Roosevelt instead.\" Bartender stares.
