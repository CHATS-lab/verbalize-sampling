Together, they formed a band called The Root Rockers. Their first gig was at the famous Mashed Ball, where they played to a crowd of hungry vegetables. The crowd cheered as Percy took center stage and belted out his hit song, \u201cMash Me Tender.\u201d After the show, a tomato critic raved, \u201cThey really peeled back the layers of talent!\u201d From that day forward, Percy and his friends toured every garden patch, proving that even a humble potato can be a star\u2014just as long as he doesn\u2019t get too fried along the way!",
