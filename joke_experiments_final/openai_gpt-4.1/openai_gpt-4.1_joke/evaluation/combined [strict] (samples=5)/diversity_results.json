      "response": "A programmer walks into a bar and orders 1.000000119 beers. The bartender, bewildered, asks, \u201cWhy such a precise number?\u201d\n\nThe programmer grins, \u201cIt\u2019s just a floating point error. I only meant to order one.\u201d\n\nThe bartender nods and pours a beer, but as the programmer takes a sip, he grimaces. \u201cThis tastes off,\u201d he says.\n\nThe bartender shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s probably just an off-by-one error. Happens all the time.\u201d\n\nJust then, a group of other programmers walk in. One orders zero beers, another orders -1 beers, and the last one orders NaN beers. The bartender sighs and mutters, \u201cWhy can\u2019t you all just be integers?\u201d\n\nThe programmers laugh, raise their glasses (or empty hands), and toast: \u201cTo bugs\u2014may they always keep us employed!\u201d\n\nAnd thus, the bar became the hotspot for every programmer who appreciated the quirks and chaos of code\u2014where every round was a new exception, and every tab led to a space for laughter.",
