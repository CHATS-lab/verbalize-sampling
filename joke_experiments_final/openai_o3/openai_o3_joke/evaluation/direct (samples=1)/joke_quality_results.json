The phrase 'writes underwater' is a clever twist, as it initially suggests something extraordinary, only to reveal a mundane punchline. This showcases a thoughtful construction and a clever observation about language."

While the concept of a pencil writing underwater is not a common joke, the structure of setting up an expectation and delivering a mundane punchline is a familiar comedic technique. It has some fresh elements but follows a predictable pattern."
